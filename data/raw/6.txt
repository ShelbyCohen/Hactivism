Gandhi, whose profound spirituality and belief in justice inspired the world.","editedTimestamp":"2017-04-28T21:55:43Z","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","profileTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><section tml-anchor=\"synopsis\"><h2>Synopsis<\/h2><p>Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, Mahatma Gandhi studied law and advocated for the civil rights of Indians, both at home under British rule and in South Africa. Gandhi became a leader of India’s independence movement, organizing boycotts against British institutions in peaceful forms of civil disobedience. He was killed by a fanatic in 1948.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"spiritual-and-political-leader\"><h2>Early Life<\/h2><p>Indian nationalist leader Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, more commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Kathiawar, India, which was then part of the British Empire. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, served as a chief minister in Porbandar and other states in western India. His mother, Putlibai, was a deeply religious woman who fasted regularly. Gandhi grew up worshiping the Hindu god Vishnu and following Jainism, a morally rigorous ancient Indian religion that espoused non-violence, fasting, meditation and vegetarianism. <\/p><p>Young Gandhi was a shy, unremarkable student who was so timid that he slept with the lights on even as a teenager. At the age of 13, he wed Kasturba Makanji, a merchant’s daughter, in an arranged marriage. In the ensuing years, the teenager rebelled by smoking, eating meat and stealing change from household servants. <\/p><p>In 1885, Gandhi endured the passing of his father and shortly after that the death of his young baby. Although Gandhi was interested in becoming a doctor, his father had hoped he would also become a government minister, so his family steered him to enter the legal profession. Shortly after the birth of the first of four surviving sons, 18-year-old Gandhi sailed for London, England, in 1888 to study law. The young Indian struggled with the transition to Western culture, and during his three-year stay in London, he became more committed to a meatless diet, joining the executive committee of the London Vegetarian Society, and started to read a variety of sacred texts to learn more about world religions. <\/p><p>Upon returning to India in 1891, Gandhi learned that his mother had died just weeks earlier. Then, he struggled to gain his footing as a lawyer. In his first courtroom case, a nervous Gandhi blanked when the time came to cross-examine a witness. He immediately fled the courtroom after reimbursing his client for his legal fees. After struggling to find work in India, Gandhi obtained a one-year contract to perform legal services in South Africa. Shortly after the birth of another son, he sailed for Durban in the South African state of Natal in April 1893.<\/p><p><\/p><h2>Spiritual and Political Leader<\/h2><p><\/p><p>When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, he was quickly appalled by the discrimination and racial segregation faced by Indian immigrants at the hands of white British and Boer authorities. Upon his first appearance in a Durban courtroom, Gandhi was asked to remove his turban. He refused and left the court instead. The Natal Advertiser mocked him in print as “an unwelcome visitor.”<\/p><p>A seminal moment in Gandhi’s life occurred days later on June 7, 1893, during a train trip to Pretoria when a white man objected to his presence in the first-class railway compartment, although he had a ticket. Refusing to move to the back of the train, Gandhi was forcibly removed and thrown off the train at a station in Pietermaritzburg. His act of civil disobedience awoke in him a determination to devote himself to fighting the “deep disease of color prejudice.” He vowed that night to “try, if possible, to root out the disease and suffer hardships in the process.” From that night forward, the small, unassuming man would grow into a giant force for civil rights.<\/p><p>Gandhi formed the Natal Indian Congress in 1894 to fight discrimination. At the end of his year-long contract, he prepared to return to India until he learned at his farewell party of a bill before the Natal Legislative Assembly that would deprive Indians of the right to vote. Fellow immigrants convinced Gandhi to stay and lead the fight against the legislation. Although Gandhi could not prevent the law’s passage, he drew international attention to the injustice. <\/p><p>After a brief trip to India in late 1896 and early 1897, Gandhi returned to South Africa with his wife and two children. Kasturba would give birth to two more sons in South Africa, one in 1897 and one in 1900. Gandhi ran a thriving legal practice, and at the outbreak of the Boer War, he raised an all-Indian ambulance corps of 1,100 volunteers to support the British cause, arguing that if Indians expected to have full rights of citizenship in the British Empire, they also needed to shoulder their responsibilities as well. <\/p><p>Gandhi continued to study world religions during his years in South Africa. “The religious spirit within me became a living force,” he wrote of his time there. He immersed himself in sacred Hindu spiritual texts and adopted a life of simplicity, austerity and celibacy that was free of material goods. <\/p><p>In 1906, Gandhi organized his first mass civil-disobedience campaign, which he called “Satyagraha” (“truth and firmness”), in reaction to the Transvaal government’s new restrictions on the rights of Indians, including the refusal to recognize Hindu marriages. After years of protests, the government imprisoned hundreds of Indians in 1913, including Gandhi. Under pressure, the South African government accepted a compromise negotiated by Gandhi and General Jan Christian Smuts that included recognition of Hindu marriages and the abolition of a poll tax for Indians. When Gandhi sailed from South Africa in 1914 to return home, Smuts wrote, “The saint has left our shores, I sincerely hope forever.”<\/p><h2>Fight for Indian Liberation<\/h2><p>After spending several months in London at the outbreak of World War I, Gandhi returned in 1915 to India, which was still under the firm control of the British, and founded an ashram in Ahmedabad open to all castes. Wearing a simple loincloth and shawl, Gandhi lived an austere life devoted to prayer, fasting and meditation. He became known as “Mahatma,” which means “great soul.”<\/p><p>In 1919, however, Gandhi had a political reawakening when the newly enacted Rowlatt Act authorized British authorities to imprison those suspected of sedition without trial. In response, Gandhi called for a Satyagraha campaign of peaceful protests and strikes. Violence broke out instead, which culminated on April 13, 1919, in the Massacre of Amritsar when troops led by British Brigadier General Reginald Dyer fired machine guns into a crowd of unarmed demonstrators and killed nearly 400 people. No longer able to pledge allegiance to the British government, Gandhi returned the medals he earned for his military service in South Africa and opposed Britain’s mandatory military draft of Indians to serve in World War I. <\/p><p>Gandhi became a leading figure in the Indian home-rule movement. Calling for mass boycotts, he urged government officials to stop working for the Crown, students to stop attending government schools, soldiers to leave their posts and citizens to stop paying taxes and purchasing British goods. Rather than buy British-manufactured clothes, he began to use a portable spinning wheel to produce his own cloth, and the spinning wheel soon became a symbol of Indian independence and self-reliance. Gandhi assumed the leadership of the Indian National Congress and advocated a policy of non-violence and non-cooperation to achieve home rule. <\/p><p>After British authorities arrested Gandhi in 1922, he pleaded guilty to three counts of sedition. Although sentenced to a six-year imprisonment, Gandhi was released in February 1924 after appendicitis surgery. He discovered upon his release that relations between India’s Hindus and Muslims had devolved during his time in jail, and when violence between the two religious groups flared again, Gandhi began a three-week fast in the autumn of 1924 to urge unity. <\/p><h2>The Salt March<\/h2><p>After remaining away from active politics during much of the latter 1920s, Gandhi returned in 1930 to protest Britain’s Salt Acts, which not only prohibited Indians from collecting or selling salt—a staple of the Indian diet—but imposed a heavy tax that hit the country’s poorest particularly hard. Gandhi planned a new Satyagraha campaign that entailed a 390-kilometer/240-mile march to the Arabian Sea, where he would collect salt in symbolic defiance of the government monopoly.  <\/p><p>“My ambition is no less than to convert the British people through non-violence and thus make them see the wrong they have done to India,” he wrote days before the march to the British viceroy, Lord Irwin. Wearing a homespun white shawl and sandals and carrying a walking stick, Gandhi set out from his religious retreat in Sabarmati on March 12, 1930, with a few dozen followers. The ranks of the marchers swelled by the time he arrived 24 days later in the coastal town of Dandi, where he broke the law by making salt from evaporated seawater.<\/p><p>The Salt March sparked similar protests, and mass civil disobedience swept across India. Approximately 60,000 Indians were jailed for breaking the Salt Acts, including Gandhi, who was imprisoned in May 1930. Still, the protests against the Salt Acts elevated Gandhi into a transcendent figure around the world, and he was named Time magazine’s “Man of the Year” for 1930. <\/p><h2>The Road to Independence<\/h2><p>Gandhi was released from prison in January 1931, and two months later he made an agreement with Lord Irwin to end the Salt Satyagraha in exchange for concessions that included the release of thousands of political prisoners. The agreement, however, largely kept the Salt Acts intact, but it did give those who lived on the coasts the right to harvest salt from the sea. Hoping that the agreement would be a stepping-stone to home rule, Gandhi attended the London Round Table Conference on Indian constitutional reform in August 1931 as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference, however, proved fruitless.<\/p><p>Gandhi returned to India to find himself imprisoned once again in January 1932 during a crackdown by India’s new viceroy, Lord Willingdon. Later that year, an incarcerated Gandhi embarked on a six-day fast to protest the British decision to segregate the “untouchables,” those on the lowest rung of India’s caste system, by allotting them separate electorates. The public outcry forced the British to amend the proposal. <\/p><p>After his eventual release, Gandhi left the Indian National Congress in 1934, and leadership passed to his protégé Jawaharlal Nehru. He again stepped away from politics to focus on education, poverty and the problems afflicting India’s rural areas.<\/p><p>As Great Britain found itself engulfed in World War II in 1942, though, Gandhi launched the “Quit India” movement that called for the immediate British withdrawal from the country. In August 1942, the British arrested Gandhi, his wife and other leaders of the Indian National Congress and detained them in the Aga Khan Palace in present-day Pune. “I have not become the King’s First Minister in order to preside at the liquidation of the British Empire,” Prime Minister Winston Churchill told Parliament in support of the crackdown. With his health failing, Gandhi was released after a 19-month detainment, but not before his 74-year-old wife died in his arms in February 1944. <\/p><p>After the Labour Party defeated Churchill’s Conservatives in the British general election of 1945, it began negotiations for Indian independence with the Indian National Congress and Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s Muslim League. Gandhi played an active role in the negotiations, but he could not prevail in his hope for a unified India. Instead, the final plan called for the partition of the subcontinent along religious lines into two independent states—predominantly Hindu India and predominantly Muslim Pakistan. <\/p><p>Violence between Hindus and Muslims flared even before independence took effect on August 15, 1947. Afterwards, the killings multiplied. Gandhi toured riot-torn areas in an appeal for peace and fasted in an attempt to end the bloodshed. Some Hindus, however, increasingly viewed Gandhi as a traitor for expressing sympathy toward Muslims.<\/p><h2>Assassination<\/h2><p>In the late afternoon of January 30, 1948, the 78-year-old Gandhi, still weakened from repeated hunger strikes, clung to his two grandnieces as they led him from his living quarters in New Delhi’s Birla House to a prayer meeting. Hindu extremist Nathuram Godse, upset at Gandhi’s tolerance of Muslims, knelt before the Mahatma before pulling out a semiautomatic pistol and shooting him three times at point-blank range. The violent act took the life of a pacifist who spent his life preaching non-violence. Godse and a co-conspirator were executed by hanging in November 1949, while additional conspirators were sentenced to life in prison. <\/p><h2>Death and Legacy<\/h2><p>Even after his death, Gandhi’s commitment to non-violence and his belief in simple living—making his own clothes, eating a vegetarian diet and using fasts for self-purification as well as a means of protest—have been a beacon of hope for oppressed and marginalized people throughout the world. Satyagraha remains one of the most potent philosophies in freedom struggles throughout the world today, and Gandhi’s actions inspired future human rights movements around the globe, including those of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States and Nelson Mandela in South Africa. <\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"video-gallery\"><h2>Videos<\/h2><\/section><div

In 1968, he  was paralyzed while fighting inthe Vietnam War. Once home, he stayed in  veteran hospitals where conditions were poor, and sought an outlet for  his outrage in activism. In 1976, he published <em>Born on the Fourth of July<\/em>. A film of same title, directed by Oliver Stone and starring Tom Cruise as Kovic, was released in 1989. Kovic continues to fight against war and in support of veterans' rights.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-life\"><h2>Early Life<\/h2><p>Ron Kovic was born on July 4, 1946, in Ladysmith, Wisconsin but was raised in Massapequa, Long Island, New York. When Kovic was growing up, his father worked as a supermarket clerk, while his mother was a stay-at-home mom to Ron and his five younger siblings.<\/p> <p>As a high school student, Kovic didn’t excel in academics. He was, however, a respected athlete in wrestling and track. He was considering a career as a professional baseball player after graduation, but a speech by a local military recruiter inspired him to enlist in the Marines instead. Kovic’s choice was reinforced by his own sense of duty, which had been instilled in him as a child of a patriotic family with a history of military service.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"vietnam-war\"><h2>Vietnam War<\/h2><p>In 1964 Kovic joined the Marines and was sent to fight in the Vietnam  War. On the battlefield, he accidentally shot a young corporal. Kovic  was shocked when his superiors refused to hear his confession.<\/p> <p>On another occasion, he and his fellow platoon members were ordered  to kill a village full of civilians. They were told the citizens of the  village were armed. After the massacre, Kovic discovered that none of  their casualties—which, to his dismay, included women and children—were  in fact armed.<\/p> <p>Having joined the Marines to become a hero, Kovic was disillusioned  by his experiences in Vietnam. On January 20, 1968, he was shot in the  spine during combat and paralyzed from the waist down. Because of his service and courage, Kovic was awarded a purple  heart. But, instead of feeling like a hero, he grappled with feelings  of guilt and shame.<\/p> <p>When Kovic returned to New York, he did not receive a hero’s  welcome—as one might expect. Facing the disdain of people who were  enraged about the Vietnam War, Kovic languished in Queens and Bronx  veterans’ hospitals where conditions were deplorably poor.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"becoming-an-activist\"><h2>Becoming an Activist<\/h2><p>Following his initial recovery period, Kovic enrolled in college in  New York. Soon after, he broke his leg while exercising and landed back  in another veteran's hospital. Again, the conditions were terrible.  Freshly indignant, Kovic sought an outlet for his outrage in activism.  He started spreading his anti-war message at local high schools. He  became increasingly active with Vietnam Veterans of America, run by  his friend at the time.<\/p> <p>Although Kovic participated in numerous rallies and demonstrations,  it wasn't until he spoke at the 1972 Republic National Convention that  he truly garnered the nation's attention. Interrupting Nixon's  acceptance speech, Kovic told the audience, \"I'm a Vietnam veteran. I  gave America my all, and the leaders of this government threw me and  others away to rot in their VA hospitals. What's happening in Vietnam is  a crime against humanity.\"<\/p> <p>Throughout the rest of the Vietnam War, Kovic remained active in  spreading his message of peace and promoting better treatment for  veterans, even going so far as to lead hunger strikes. In 1976 he gave a  speech at the Democratic National Convention. That same year, he  published a best-selling autobiography, <em>Born on the Fourth of July<\/em>,  detailing his experiences as a Vietnam veteran. A film of same  title—based on Kovic's book—directed by Oliver Stone and starring Tom  Cruise as Kovic, was released in 1989. The film won two Academy Awards and several Golden Globe Awards, and increased public awareness of the activist's causes.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"in-recent-years\"><h2>In Recent Years<\/h2><p>In 2003, Kovic led demonstrations protesting the war in  Iraq during the George W. Bush administration. His recent activism also  includes arguing for the construction of a Los Angeles facility for  homeless and disabled veterans. Kovic continues to fight for  improvements in the way veterans are treated when they return home from  battle.<\/p> <p>Because Kovic found the experience of making the film <em>Born on the Fourth of July <\/em>cathartic  and healing, he established a peace prize in his name, and on a yearly  basis, has been awarding a prize to \"the filmmaker who best addresses  the issues of peace in a short film.\"<\/p><\/section>","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396478988,"id":"ci01a8bfd62546860b","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Ron-Kovic-21058843-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01a8bfd62546860b","hasFaces":false,"width":402,"publicId":"MTIwNjA4NjM0MTkxNzc1MjQ0","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T22:49:50Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":97044,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a33b79f056860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"United States","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396412473,"id":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"William-Atherton-4822-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE1ODA0OTcxMjQ2ODQ3NTAx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:14Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":76197,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:birth_country","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","disqusId":"3c2c2230-ba1e-11e3-9706-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","path":"/people/groups/born-in-united-states","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"born-in-united-states","displayName":"United States","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous People Born in United States","primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","statusCode":"complete"},"bestKnownFor":"Vietnam War veteran and anti-war activist Ron Kovic wrote the autobiography Born on the Fourth of July, the basis of the Oliver Stone film starring Tom Cruise.","createdTimestamp":"2017-04-28T04:22:26Z","path":"/people/ron-kovic-21058843","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"ron-kovic-21058843","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","lastName":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T22:49:42Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01ac7ce9edd9860c","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Kovic","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396478988,"id":"ci01a8bfd62546860b","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Ron-Kovic-21058843-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01a8bfd62546860b","hasFaces":false,"width":402,"publicId":"MTIwNjA4NjM0MTkxNzc1MjQ0","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T22:49:50Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":97044,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:last_name","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T22:49:51Z","disqusId":"199fa1b0-bab9-11e3-a4b8-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T22:49:42Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T22:49:51Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci01a8bfd62546860b","path":"/people/groups/famous-named-kovic","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"famous-named-kovic","displayName":"Kovic","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous People Named Kovic","primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","statusCode":"complete"},"promoTitle":"Ron Kovic","featuredMedia":{"isInstantArticle":false,"primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b8226d860f","height":1080,"cloudinaryVersionId":1487376100,"id":"ci0203a4b650002598","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Ron Kovic -

He graduated from Columbia University and was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1963. In 1968, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he became known for his attempts to end the draft during the Vietnam War and for releasing the Pentagon Papers. Gravel ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. In March of that year, he left the Democrats and switched to the Libertarian Party. With little success in the elections, Gravel ultimately left elected office but remained politically active and championing his ideas through the years.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-life\"><h2>Early Life<\/h2><p>Former U.S. Senator Mike Gravel was born Maurice Robert Gravel on May 13, 1930, in Springfield, Massachusetts. The son of French-Canadian immigrants, Gravel attended French-speaking Catholic schools and spoke French exclusively until he was 7 years old. He worked in his father's construction business with his brothers until enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1951.<\/p> <p>After his tour of duty, during which he served primarily in intelligence services, Gravel earned his B.S. in Economics from Columbia University. He drove a New York City cab to help put himself through school.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"speaker-of-the-house-and-us-senator\"><h2>Speaker of the House and U.S. Senator<\/h2><p>In the late 1950s, Mike Gravel moved to Alaska believing that in this  remote state someone like him, without social or political connections,  stood a chance of winning political races. He had success in real estate  development and other sectors while biding his time before entering  politics.<\/p> <p>Gravel was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1963, and  served as its Speaker of the House from 1965 to 1966. In 1968, he was  elected to the United States Senate, where he served two terms until  1981. As senator, Gravel served on the Finance, Interior and  Environmental and Public Works committees. He became nationally known  for his attempts to end the draft during the Vietnam War, releasing the  Pentagon Papers into public record in 1971 and championing Congressional  approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. Other positions Gravel has held include the decriminalization of drugs, supporting same-sex marriage, cutting military spending, increasing education spending, opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, adding a carbon tax, closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and promoting a publicly-funded voucher-style health care system.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"later-political-career\"><h2>Later Political Career<\/h2><p>After losing his bid for a third term in 1980, Gravel returned to the  private sector where numerous failed business ventures and poor health  beset him.<\/p> <p>In 2006, Gravel announced his candidacy for the Democratic Party  nomination in the 2008 presidential election in large part to promote  direct democracy and the National Initiative. Though he gained a  small loyal following, particularly online with his eccentric YouTube  campaign, he was consistently low in the national polls.

He was arrested for protesting at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, becoming one of the \"Chicago Seven\" defendants who were convicted for conspiracy to incite violence but later had their convictions overturned.<\/p> <p>Wed briefly to fellow activist Sandra \"Casey\" Cason in his early 20s, Hayden married actress-turned-activist <a href=\"/people/jane-fonda-9298034\">Jane Fonda<\/a> in 1973. That same year, the couple had a son together, actor Troy Garity (born Troi O’Donovan Garity Hayden). In addition to producing such anti-war movies as <em>Introduction to the Enemy<\/em>, the couple sought to win over political converts by giving speeches throughout the country, and transformed their Santa Barbara ranch into an egalitarian children's camp.<\/p> <blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p>“I didn’t want to report on the world; I wanted to change it.” - Tom Hayden<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Following an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate in 1976, Hayden formed the Campaign for Economic Democracy and became chairman of the California SolarCal Council. He ran for public office again in 1982, and served in the California State Assembly for 10 years.<\/p> <p>Hayden and&nbsp;Fonda divorced in 1990. He&nbsp;married Canadian actress Barbara Williams shortly after being voted into the California State Senate in 1992. Despite helping to pass more than 100 measures during his time in office, tackling issues ranging from small-business tax relief to the reduction of gang and domestic violence to the welfare of shelter animals, his political career stalled. Hayden fell short in his attempts to become governor of California in 1994 and mayor of Los Angeles in 1997, and failed to secure a spot on the Los Angeles City Council in 2001 after leaving the State Senate.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Hayden and Williams adopted a son, Liam, in 2000.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"later-years\"><h2>Later Years &amp; Death<\/h2><p>Having already published several books, including his 1988 autobiography, <em>Reunion: A Memoir<\/em>, Hayden focused more on writing in the new millennium with regular contributions to such publications as <em>The New York Times<\/em>, <em>The Huffington Post<\/em> and <em>The Nation<\/em>.

story of brilliant linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky.\n","editedTimestamp":"2016-06-07T20:02:09Z","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","profileTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><section tml-anchor=\"synopsis\"><h2>Synopsis<\/h2><p>Born in Philadelphia on December 7, 1928, Noam Chomsky was an intellectual prodigy who went on to earn a PhD in linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania. Since 1955, he has been a professor at MIT and has produced groundbreaking, controversial theories on human linguistic capacity. Chomsky is widely published, both on topics in his field and on issues of dissent and U.S. foreign policy.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-life\"><h2>A Brilliant Child<\/h2><p>Noam Chomsky was a brilliant child, and his curiosities and intellect were kindled greatly by his early experiences. Born in Philadelphia on December 7, 1928, Chomsky felt the weight of America's Great Depression. He was raised with a younger brother, David, and although his own family was middle class, he witnessed injustices all around him. One of his earliest memories consisted of watching security officers beat women strikers outside of a textile plant.<\/p> <p>His mother, Elsie Chomsky, had been active in the radical politics of the 1930s. His father, William, a Russian Jewish immigrant like his mother, was a respected professor of Hebrew at Gratz College, an institution for teacher’s training. At the age of 10, while attending a progressive school that emphasized student self-actualization, Chomsky wrote an editorial on the rise of fascism in Europe after the Spanish Civil War for his school newspaper. Rather amazingly, his story was substantially researched enough to be the basis for a later essay he would present at New York University.<\/p> <p>By the age of 13, Chomsky was traveling from Philadelphia to New York, spending much of his time listening to the disparate perspectives hashed out among adults over cigarettes and magazines at his uncle’s newsstand at the back of a 72nd Street subway exit. Chomsky greatly admired his uncle, a man of little formal education, but someone who was wildly smart about the world around him. Chomsky’s current political views spring from this type of lived-experience stance, positing that all people can understand politics and economics and make their own decisions, and that authority ought to be tested before being deemed legitimate and worthy of power.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"undergraduate-work-and-marriage\"><h2>The Scholar<\/h2><p>Just as World War II was coming to a close, Chomsky began his studies at the University of Pennsylvania. He found little use for his classes until he met Zellig S. Harris, an American scholar touted for discovering structural linguistics (breaking language down into distinct parts or levels). Chomsky was moved by what he felt language could reveal about society. Harris was moved by Chomsky’s great potential and did much to advance the young man’s undergraduate studies, with Chomsky receiving his B.A. and M.A in nontraditional modes of study.<\/p> <p>Harris introduced Chomsky to Harvard mathematician Nathan Fine and philosophers Nelson Goodman and&nbsp;W. V. Quine. Although an industrious student of Goodman's, Chomsky&nbsp;drastically disagreed with his approach. Goodman believed the human mind was a blank slate, whereas Chomsky believed the basic concepts of language were innate in every human’s mind and then only influenced by one’s syntactical environment. His 1951 master’s thesis was titled \"The Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew.\"<\/p> <p>In 1949, Chomsky married educational specialist Carol Schatz, a woman he had known since childhood. The relationship lasted for 59 years, until she died from cancer in 2008. They had three children together. For a short time, between Chomsky’s master's and doctoral studies, the couple lived on a kibbutz in Israel. When they returned, Chomsky continued at the University of Pennsylvania and executed some of his research and writing at Harvard University. His dissertation eventually explored several ideas that he would soon lay out in one of his best-known books on linguistics, <em>Syntactic Structures<\/em> (1957).<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"professorial-career\"><h2>Linguistic Revolutions<\/h2><p>In 1955, the professorial staff at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) invited Chomsky to join their ranks. Now a professor emeritus, he worked in the school's Department of Linguistics &amp; Philosophy for half a century before retiring from active teaching in 2005. He has also been a visiting professor or lectured at a range of other universities, including Columbia, UCLA, Princeton and Cambridge, and holds honorary degrees from countless others throughout the world.<\/p> <p>During his career as a professor, Chomsky introduced transformational grammar to the linguistics field. His theory asserts that languages are innate and that the differences we see are only due to parameters developed over time in our brains, helping to explain why children are able to learn different languages more easily than adults. One of his most famous contributions to linguistics is what his contemporaries have called the Chomsky Hierarchy, a division of grammar into groups, moving up or down in their expressive abilities. These ideas have had huge ramifications in fields such as modern psychology and philosophy, both answering and raising questions about human nature and how we process information.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Chomsky’s writings on linguistics include <em>Current Issues in Linguistic Theor<\/em>y (1964), <em>Aspects of the Theory of Syntax <\/em>(1965), <em>The Sound Pattern of English<\/em> (with Morris Halle, 1968), <em>Language and Mind<\/em> (1972), <em>Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar<\/em> (1972), and <em>Knowledge of Language <\/em>(1986). &nbsp;<\/p><h2>Politics and Controversies<\/h2> <p>But Chomsky’s ideas have never been relegated to language alone.&nbsp;Weaving between the world of academia and popular culture, Chomsky has also gained a reputation for his often radical political views,&nbsp;which he describes as \"libertarian socialist,\"&nbsp;some of which have been seen as controversial and highly open to debate.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In 1967, <em>The New York Review of Books <\/em>published his essay \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals.\" In light of the Vietnam War, which Chomsky adamantly opposed, he addressed what he saw as a disgracefully resigned intellectual community, of which he was an embarrassed member, with the hope of igniting his peers into deeper thought and action.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19770625.htm\">a 1977 article Chomsky co-authored with Edward S. Herman in <em>The Nation<\/em><\/a>, he questioned the credibility of the reporting of atrocities under the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia and suggested some reports were propaganda to \"place the role of the United States in a more favorable light.\" Decades later, Chomsky acknowledged in the 1993 documentary <em>Manufacturing Consent<\/em> “the great act of genocide in the modern period is Pol Pot, 1975 through 1978. . . .\" &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>In 1979, Chomsky signed a petition in support of the free-speech rights of Robert Faurisson, a French lecturer who denied the existence of the gas chambers used in Nazi concentration camps. As a result, Chomsky found himself in the middle of a heated controversy, and in response he asserted that his views are <a href=\"http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19810228.htm\">\"diametrically opposed\" to Faurisson's conclusions <\/a>and his intent was to support Faurisson's civil liberties not his Holocaust denial. The incident haunted Chomsky for decades, however, and his reputation in France in particular was damaged for some time afterward.<\/p><p>Chomsky also sparked controversy with <em>9-11: Was There an Alternative?<\/em>, his 2002 collection of essays which analyzes the September 11 attacks on the United States, the impact of U.S. foreign policy and media control. In the book, Chomsky denounces the “horrifying atrocities” of the attacks, but is critical of the United States’ use of power, calling it “a leading terrorist state.” The book became a best seller, denounced by conservative critics as a distortion of American history while praised by supporters as offering an honest analysis of events leading to 9-11 that weren't being reported by the mainstream media. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>Among his many books addressing politics are <em>American Power and the New Mandarins<\/em> (1969), <em>Peace in the Middle East?<\/em> (1974), <em>Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media<\/em> (with Edward S. Herman, 1988), <em>Profit over People <\/em>(1998), <em>Rogue States <\/em>(2000), <em>Hegemony or Survival <\/em>(2003),&nbsp;<em>Gaza in Crisis <\/em>(with Ilan Pappé, 2010),<em>&nbsp;<\/em>and most recently, <em>On Western Terrorism: From Hiroshima to Drone Warfare<\/em>&nbsp;(2013).<\/p><h2>Current Affairs<\/h2><p>Despite his often controversial viewpoints, Chomsky remains a highly respected and sought-after thinker who continues to author new books and contribute to a wide variety of journals and remains active on the lecture circuit. Over the course of his career, Chomsky has also amassed a wealth of academic and humanitarian awards, including the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association, the Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences and the humanitarian Sydney Peace Prize.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In 2014, at age 85, Chomsky remarried, to Valeria Wasserman.&nbsp;<\/p><\/section>","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396414109,"id":"ci01ac7ce9c1a2860c","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Noam-Chomsky-37616-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01ac7ce9c1a2860c","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE5NTU2MzE1ODY5NzA5ODM1","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:48:31Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":75971,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a33b79f056860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"United

Since breaking from the band in 1975, he has gone on to enjoy tremendous success as a solo artist. His 1986 album <em>So<\/em> featured such hits as “Sledgehammer, “Big Time” and “In Your Eyes.” Gabriel later released <em>Us<\/em> (1992) and <em>Up<\/em> (2002). He is also one of the founders of the WOMAD Foundation and Real World Records. \n<\/p><h2>Early On<\/h2><p>Peter Gabriel was born on February 13, 1950, in Woking, England, and grew up on a farm in Coxhill near Chobham. His father, Ralph, was an electrical engineer and avid inventor. His mother, Edith, passed down her love of music to her son. After attending local schools in his early youth, in 1963 Gabriel attended boarding school at Charterhouse in Godalming.<\/p><p>At Charterhouse, Gabriel explored his interest in music, eventually forming the band Garden Wall with keyboard player Tony Banks, guitarist Anthony Phillips and bassist Mike Rutherford. In 1967, on the advice of a producer, they changed the name of their prog rock ensemble to Genesis.\n<\/p><h2>The Genesis Years\n<\/h2><p>With Gabriel serving as the group's frontman, Genesis released its first single, \"The Silent Sun,\" in 1968, and the following year put out its debut album,&nbsp;<em>From Genesis to Revelation<\/em>. Though the record failed to attract much notice, its follow-up effort, <em>Trespass<\/em>, fared better,&nbsp;and&nbsp;by 1971’s <em>Nursery Cryme <\/em>the band had begun to catch on with listeners, just cracking&nbsp;the UK’s Top 40 album chart. (It&nbsp;was also the first album to feature their new drummer, future hitmaker <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/phil-collins-17178742#genesis-and-solo-career\">Phil Collins<\/a>.)<\/p><p>Genesis's next release, 1972’s <em>Foxtrot<\/em>, climbed higher, reaching the No. 12 spot, and <em>Selling England by the Pound <\/em>(1973)&nbsp;did even better, reaching No. 3 in England, as well as charting in the U.S. More than their studio recordings, however, by this point the band was perhaps best known for its live shows, which featured Gabriel's intriguing onstage performances involving costumes and props.<\/p><p>Genesis continued to thrive professionally over the next couple years, but at the same time, tensions began to emerge within the band, due in part to the fact that Gabriel took time away from the group to work on a project with director William Friedkin. As he later told <em>Rolling Stone<\/em>, \"Genesis, at that time, were not into anyone having extracurricular activities.&nbsp;And there was also a certain jealousy, because as frontman I was being credited as sole creative source of the band, which was really unfair.”&nbsp;<\/p><p>Gabriel’s last album with Genesis was 1974’s <em>The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway<\/em>. And following a tour to support the record, Gabriel left the band. Phil Collins took over as frontman of Genesis following his departure, and the group went on to enjoy a lasting period of success. In 2010 Gabriel and the other members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p><h2>Solo<\/h2><p>But Gabriel's notable talents would soon lead to an even greater solo career. In 1977, he released his first self-titled album, which featured the single \"Solsbury Hill\" and made both the U.K. Top 10 and the U.S. Top 40. Quickly following up this initial effort, Gabriel released his second self-titled record the next year. But it was with his third self-titled album, released in 1980, that he experienced his first major success on the music charts. The song “Games Without Frontiers” was a Top 5 hit in Britain and made the Top 40 in the U.S. It also included the track “Biko,” written about slain anti-Apartheid activist Steve Biko. Gabriel would later write on his website that it “became a very important song for me. I’d not written an overtly political song before and was wondering if it would be accepted.”<\/p><p>&nbsp;At the same time that he was exploring his political consciousness, Gabriel was also nurturing his interest in other forms of creative expression, and he helped found the World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD). The first WOMAD international arts festival was held in 1982 and has enjoyed a successful run ever since. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>Further branching out, Gabriel also made his first foray into soundtrack work, composing the music for the 1985 drama&nbsp;<em>Birdy <\/em>starring <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/matthew-modine-21187367\">Matthew Modine<\/a>.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"youtube\" tml-external-id=\"3xZmlUV8muY\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xZmlUV8muY\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3xZmlUV8muY/hqdefault.jpg\"><\/div><h2>Big Time<\/h2><p>With his fifth studio album,&nbsp;<em>So <\/em>(1986), Gabriel outdid all of his previous efforts, hitting No, 1 in the U.K. and No. 2 in the U.S. Its&nbsp;energetic, catchy single “Sledgehammer” became his first No. 1 song, propelled in part by a creative accompanying video, and the rhythmically driven “Big Time” reached No. 2. Gabriel also demonstrated his gift for slower, more dramatic songs, such as “Don’t Give Up” and \"In Your Eyes,\" with the latter drawing a cult following after it was featured in the soundtrack of&nbsp;<a href=\"/people/cameron-crowe-9542591\">Cameron Crowe<\/a>'s iconic&nbsp;1989 teen-romance film <em>Say Anything<\/em>.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"youtube\" tml-external-id=\"OJWJE0x7T4Q\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJWJE0x7T4Q\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OJWJE0x7T4Q/hqdefault.jpg\"><\/div><p>But superstardom did not lessen Gabriel's personal convictions, and around this time he also participated in two tours for Amnesty International. His soundtrack work was thriving as well, and he won his first Grammy Award in 1990 for his score&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href=\"/people/martin-scorsese-9476727\">Martin Scorsese<\/a>’s film <em>The Last Temptation of Christ<\/em>. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Gabriel returned to the rock music scene with 1992’s <em>Us<\/em>, which featured such popular songs as “Steam” (No. 2) and \"Digging in the Dirt” (No. 1), both of which earned Gabriel Grammy wins with their imaginative music videos.<\/p><p>Nearly a decade after <em>Us<\/em>, Gabriel released <em>Up<\/em> (2002), which failed to match the success of his earlier efforts. Still, songs such as “Signal to Noise” and “The Barry Williams Show” received positive notice. More recently, Gabriel worked on a pair of themed albums: First came <em>Scratch My Back <\/em>(2010), which offered listeners Gabriel’s take on the music of other artists. Many of these artists returned the favor by covering some of Gabriel’s classic songs on A<em>nd I’ll Scratch Yours<\/em> (2013). The following year, he received an even greater honor was he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist. In early 2016, Gabriel announced an upcoming tour with Sting, scheduled for the summer.\n<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"youtube\" tml-external-id=\"RdCZH_ppmek\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdCZH_ppmek\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RdCZH_ppmek/hqdefault.jpg\"><\/div><h2>Personal Life\n<\/h2><p>Gabriel is married to Meabh Flynn.

In 1971 he founded the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen and has continued to be an opponent of unchecked corporate power. Beginning in the 1990s, Nader entered the U.S. presidential race multiple times, with a notable run as candidate for the Green Party in the 2000 election.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-life\"><h2>A Sense of Justice<\/h2><p>Born on February 27, 1934, in Winsted, Connecticut, Ralph Nader was the youngest of four children. His parents, Rose and Nathra, were Lebanese immigrants who owned a restaurant and bakery that became a gathering place for the small community in which they lived. At both the restaurant and the dinner table at home, politics and current events were discussed freely, and Nathra instilled in his children a sense of social justice.<\/p><p>Nader attended the preparatory Gilbert School in his hometown and later Princeton University, both on scholarships. In 1955, he graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in East Asian studies from the Woodrow Wilson School of International Affairs at Princeton. While there, Nader made one of his first forays into activism, trying unsuccessfully to stop the university from using the now widely banned pesticide DDT on campus trees. <\/p><p>    After graduating from Princeton, Nader attended Harvard Law School. While there, he served as the editor of the <em>Harvard Law Record<\/em>, in which he published his first article on the automobile industry, “American Cars: Designed for Death.\" Nader argued that auto fatalities did not result just from driver error but from poor vehicle design as well.&nbsp;<\/p><h2><strong>Unsafe at Any Speed<\/strong><\/h2><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"publications\"><p>After receiving his law degree with distinction in 1958, Nader served briefly in the U.S. Army before working as a freelance journalist on several continents. He returned to Connecticut in 1959, settling in Hartford, where he began to practice law. In 1961 Nader also began to teach history and government at the University of Hartford.&nbsp;<\/p><p>By 1963, however, he had grown bored with practicing law and decided to relocate to Washington, D.C., where he hoped to make more of a difference. He didn’t have to wait long. In 1964, Nader’s college article on auto safety and design caught the attention of Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel P. Moynihan, who had long been interested in automobile safety design and had written an article of his own in 1959 titled “Epidemic on the Highways.” In 1965 Moynihan hired Nader as a part-time consultant at the Labor Department. Nader subsequently wrote a background report making recommendations for federal regulation in highway safety, however, it received little attention. <\/p><p>After leaving the Department of Labor in May 1965, Nader proceeded to write what would become his breakout book, <em>Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile, <\/em>published in November of that year. In this classic of muckraking journalism, Nader criticized the auto industry for putting style and power over safety, and questioned the federal government's lax attitude on regulation. In particular, Nader cited the Chevrolet Corvair as a poorly designed automobile and produced convincing evidence that a driver could lose control of the vehicle even at slow speeds. <em>Unsafe<\/em> also promoted the philosophy regarding government regulation of industry that has guided Nader's efforts ever since: Economic interests, which ignore the harmful effects of their applied science and technology, need to be controlled.&nbsp;<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"presidential-run\"><h2>The Auto Industry Strikes Back<\/h2><p>General Motors (GM)—the world’s largest corporation at the time, and producer of the Chevrolet Corvair—did not take kindly to Nader’s crusade. The company sent investigators to harass Nader and make menacing phone calls to his friends and family. Private investigators spied on his activities and attempted to discredit him by allegedly luring him into compromising situations with women.<\/p><p>General Motors’ investigation of Nader came to light in 1966, during U.S. Senate hearings on auto safety. After repeated questioning and admonishments by committee members, GM chief James Roche publicly apologized for any alleged wrongdoing, but denied that GM had tried to trap Nader in any lurid activities. Later, Nader sued GM and won a judgement of $425,000, which he used to found the Center for Auto Safety and several other public-interest groups.<\/p><h2>The Advocate<\/h2><p>      \u0014Nader’s testimony before the Senate also set in motion Congressional action on automobile safety, and in September 1966 President <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/lyndon-b-johnson-9356122\">Lyndon Johnson<\/a> signed into law the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.  This law created the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees federal safety standards for automobiles and is authorized to impose recalls for unsafe vehicles. In 1967, in a throwback to <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/upton-sinclair-9484897\">Upton Sinclair<\/a>, Nader also initiated a campaign that led to the passage of the 1967 Wholesome Meat Act, which imposed federal standards on slaughterhouses. &nbsp;<\/p><p>In the late 1960s and mid-1970s, Ralph Nader mobilized college students to form Public Interest Research Groups (PIRG), which aided his investigations in public policy and effective government regulation. His professional associates, sometimes referred to derisively as \"Nader's Raiders,\" published reports on a wide range of subjects, including baby food, insecticides, mercury poisoning and coal-mine safety. Nader also founded the Center for Responsive Law in 1968 and Public Citizen Inc. in 1971. Idealistic and modest, he became known among his associates for his Spartan personal habits and long working hours. <\/p><p>However, in the 1980s, President <a href=\"/people/ronald-reagan-9453198\">Ronald Reagan<\/a> dismantled many of the government regulations that Nader helped establish. But while this blunted his effectiveness for a time, Nader continued his crusades to lower car-insurance rates in California, expose the dangers of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on the ozone layer and prevent limitations on consumer lawsuit rewards. Amidst these activist efforts, Nader also wrote several more books, including&nbsp;<em>The Menace of Atomic Energy<\/em> (1977), <em>Who's Poisoning America&nbsp;<\/em>(1981), <em>Good Works<\/em> (1981) and <em>No Contest<\/em> (1996).&nbsp;<\/p><h2>Candidate<\/h2><p>Stepping even further into the world of politics, Nader ran for president in every election from 1992 to 2008. In all of them, he operated a no-frills campaign, accepting no corporate or taxpayer money. In 2000, claiming he could see no difference between Republican candidate&nbsp;<a href=\"/people/george-w-bush-9232768\">George W. Bush<\/a> and Democratic candidate&nbsp;<a href=\"/people/al-gore-9316028\">Al Gore<\/a>, Nader ran for president as the candidate for the Green Party. The election turned out to be one of the closest in American history between the two major party candidates.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Gore ultimately lost the election, and Nader was accused of having taken support away from him in several key states, especially Florida, where Gore lost by 537 votes. Subsequent studies on the election were divided in their assessment of how influential Nader’s campaign actually was, however most political experts point to the fact that Gore lost in his home state of Tennessee, that over 250,000 Democrats in Florida voted for Bush and that it was the U.S. Supreme Court that halted the recount in Florida, allowing Bush to ultimately win the election. Ignoring the harsh criticism, Nader ran for president again in 2004 and 2008 as an independent, winning 0.38 and 0.56 percent of the popular vote, respectively.<\/p><p>In 2012 and 2016, Ralph Nader declined to run again for president, but said he was looking for “enlightened billionaires” to put his support behind.&nbsp;<\/p><p>However, during his period of perpetual candidacy, he wrote scores of letters to serving presidents on campaign finance reform, the minimum wage and Supreme Court nominations. He has compiled these letters into a collection titled&nbsp;<em>Return to Sender: Unanswered Letters to the President, 2001<\/em>–<em>2015<\/em>. Nader claims the book sets a higher standard and tries to stimulate Americans to write letters to their representatives.<\/p><p>Ever consumed with his many endeavors, Nader has never married.<\/p><\/section>","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396449727,"id":"ci01a87e1d737d860f","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Ralph-Nader-9419799-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01a87e1d737d860f","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTIwNjA4NjMzOTI0MTI2MjIw","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T14:42:09Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":42485,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a33b79f056860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"United States","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396412473,"id":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"William-Atherton-4822-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE1ODA0OTcxMjQ2ODQ3NTAx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:14Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":76197,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:birth_country","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","disqusId":"3c2c2230-ba1e-11e3-9706-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","path":"/people/groups/born-in-united-states","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"born-in-united-states","displayName":"United States","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous People Born in United States","primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","statusCode":"complete"},"bestKnownFor":"Attorney, activist and politician Ralph Nader is an auto-safety reformer and consumer advocate.

After embarking on a successful career with Warner Bros., in 1947 Trumbo joined nine colleagues in refusing to testify before Congress regarding their Communist ties. The so-called \"Hollywood Ten\" were blacklisted from that time until the early 1960s. Trumbo died of a heart attack on September 10, 1976, in Los Angeles, California. &nbsp;<\/p><h2>Heading West&nbsp;<\/h2><p>James Dalton Trumbo was born in Montrose, Colorado, on December 9, 1905, the first son of shoe-store clerk Orus and his wife, Maud. When Trumbo was 3 years old, his family moved to nearby Grand Junction, where he would spend his youth. While attending high school there, he indulged an early interest in writing by working as a cub reporter for a local paper.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Trumbo continued his journalistic pursuits while attending the University of Colorado before leaving the state in 1925 to join his family, who had moved to Los Angeles after he graduated high school. When his father died the following year, Trumbo took a job in a bakery to help support his mother and younger sisters. He worked there for nearly 10 years while cranking out countless short stories and novels—none of which he could find a publisher for—attending the University of California and working several other odd jobs.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>A Prized Writer<\/h2><p>In the early 1930s, Trumbo began to write professionally, publishing articles and stories in magazines such as the <em>Saturday Evening Post<\/em>, <em>Vanity Fair<\/em> and the <em>Hollywood Spectator<\/em>. He became the managing editor of the <em>Spectator<\/em> in 1934, a year that also saw him publish his first novel, <em>Eclipse<\/em>, as well as land a job as a script reader in the Warner Bros. story department. Then in 1935 Trumbo signed a contract with the studio as a junior writer, launching what would prove to be a long—and complicated—career.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In 1936 Trumbo received his first screenwriting credit, specifically for the crime drama <em>Road Gang<\/em>, and over the course of the next 10 years became one of the most successful and sought after writers in Hollywood. Some highlights among his many credits are <em>A Man to Remember<\/em> (1938), the 1940 romantic drama <em>Kitty Foyle <\/em>(which starred <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/ginger-rogers-9462173\">Ginger Rogers<\/a> and earned Trumbo his first Academy Award nomination, for best adapted screenplay) and the highly lauded World War II drama <em>Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo<\/em> (1944), starring&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/spencer-tracy-9509626\">Spencer Tracy<\/a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/robert-mitchum-9410558\">Robert Mitchum<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p><p>During this time, Trumbo was finding success away from the studio as well. In 1939 he married Cleo Fincher, with whom he would have three children, and in September of that year he achieved his peak as a novelist with the antiwar story <em>Johnny Got His Gun<\/em>. The novel received a National Book Award and has been adapted numerous times for radio, stage and screen.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>Blacklisted&nbsp;<\/h2><p>Although the success of <em>Johnny Got His Gun<\/em>&nbsp;earned Trumbo notoriety as an author, the work eventually garnered him a fair share of unwanted attention as well. Like many intellectuals and artists at the time, Trumbo was a member of the Communist Party and during his career had frequently taken unpopular left-leaning political positions. But when he received fan letters from Nazi sympathizers who had misunderstood his intentions with <em>Johnny Got His Gun<\/em>, Trumbo reported them to the FBI. Rather than pursue the letter writers, however, the bureau opened an investigation of Trumbo.<\/p><blockquote tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><p><strong>\"The chief internal enemies of any state are those public officials who betray the trust imposed upon them by the people.\" - Dalton Trumbo<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote><p>In October 1947, as postwar paranoia about the perceived threat of Communism was ramping up in the United States, Trumbo was among a group of 10 Hollywood directors and writers called to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), which was charged with investigating whether Communist sympathizers had propagandized American audiences. Trumbo and the other nine individuals summoned all refused to testify, and as a consequence, the “Hollywood Ten” were found guilty of contempt of Congress. They were subsequently blacklisted by the heads of the major studios, and in 1950 Trumbo served almost a year in prison.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>Robert Rich and Other Not-Trumbos&nbsp;<\/h2><p>Following his release, Trumbo was unable to find work in California and moved his family to Mexico City. From there, he continued to write screenplays, which he was able to sell by using either pseudonyms or other writers to act as fronts for his work. During this time, Trumbo wrote at least 10 screenplays that were made into films—including the 1953 classic <em>Roman Holiday<\/em>, starring <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/gregory-peck-9436049\">Gregory Peck<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/audrey-hepburn-9335788\">Audrey Hepburn<\/a>—as well as doing an unknown quantity of revision work on many others.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Finally, in 1957, after nearly a decade of working in exile, Trumbo at last saw an opportunity to return to Hollywood, when his screenplay for <em>The Brave One<\/em>—written under the pseudonym Robert Rich—received an Academy Award. When journalists were subsequently unable to find the mysterious Robert Rich for comment, it was soon surmised that the film had in fact been written by Trumbo. This and other similar incidents involving blacklisted writers led to a general reexamination of the practice, with support for the concept quickly weakening in the industry.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The year after “Robert Rich” won the Oscar for<em> The Brave One<\/em>, Trumbo was hired to write the adaptation for the&nbsp;best-selling&nbsp;novel about the creation of Israel,&nbsp;<em>Exodus<\/em>, and in 1959 he was chosen by <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/kirk-douglas-9278036\">Kirk Douglas<\/a> to author the screenplay for <em>Spartacus<\/em>. Trumbo’s authorship of these two highly successful pictures was revealed shortly before their release in 1960, along with the announcement that Trumbo would receive credit for his work. Shortly thereafter he was readmitted to the Writers Guild of America, effectively bringing the blacklist to an end.&nbsp;<\/p><h2>Back in the Fold&nbsp;<\/h2><p>Trumbo returned to work in earnest and for the remainder of his life continued his prolific and successful output. Of the many screenplays that he wrote during this post-blacklist era, some highlights are the Kirk Douglas western <em>Lonely Are the Brave <\/em>(1962), the Golden Globe–nominated crime drama <em>The Fixer<\/em> (1968) and the 1973 prison classic <em>Papillon<\/em>, starring <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/steve-mcqueen-9394602\">Steve McQueen<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/dustin-hoffman-9341124\">Dustin Hoffman<\/a>. Revisiting the work that was at the root of so much of his past troubles, Trumbo wrote and directed a 1971 film adaption of <em>Johnny Got His Gun<\/em>, for which he received two awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Several years later he was finally delivered his Oscar for <em>The Brave One.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p>A heavy smoker for much of his life, in 1973 Trumbo was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died of a heart attack while in hospice care several years later, on September 10, 1976, in Los Angeles, California, and donated his body to science. In 1993, 40 years after the film’s release, Trumbo was posthumously awarded an Oscar for his screenplay for <em>Roman Holiday<\/em>.<\/p><h2>Trumbo Redux&nbsp;<\/h2><p>Since his death, Dalton Trumbo has been the subject of a&nbsp;variety of different works, including a 2003 Broadway play called <em>Trumbo: Red, White and Blacklisted<\/em> and a related 2009 documentary. In September 2015, a new biographical drama titled <em>Trumbo<\/em> premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Starring <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/bryan-cranston-21347665\">Bryan Cranston<\/a> as Trumbo, and with a cast that includes <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/helen-mirren-547434\">Helen Mirren<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/john-goodman-476702\">John Goodman<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/diane-lane-9542310\">Diane Lane<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/louis-ck-21014255\">Louis C.K.<\/a>, the film is scheduled for a November 2015 domestic release.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"youtube\" tml-external-id=\"n0dZ_2ICpJE\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0dZ_2ICpJE\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n0dZ_2ICpJE/hqdefault.jpg\"><\/div><p>\n    <\/p>\n\n    \n    \n<\/section>","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396457730,"id":"ci01ac7ce9e203860c","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Dalton-Trumbo-9511141-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01ac7ce9e203860c","hasFaces":false,"width":402,"publicId":"MTIwNjA4NjMzOTkzMTM1NjI4","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T16:55:32Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":75725,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a33b79f056860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"United States","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396412473,"id":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"William-Atherton-4822-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE1ODA0OTcxMjQ2ODQ3NTAx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:14Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":76197,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:birth_country","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","disqusId":"3c2c2230-ba1e-11e3-9706-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","path":"/people/groups/born-in-united-states","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"born-in-united-states","displayName":"United States","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous People Born in United States","primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","statusCode":"complete"},"bestKnownFor":"Dalton Trumbo was an award-winning author and screenwriter who was blacklisted from the film industry from 1947 until the early '60s due to his Communist ties.","createdTimestamp":"2016-02-18T20:16:15Z","groups":[{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T03:03:31Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"metaDescription":"Explore Biography's collection of famous people who were blacklisted.

In 1969 he enrolled at the University of Oxford, receiving his B.Phil. degree from the school two years later.

Singer grew up in Melbourne, where he eventually attended the University of Melbourne, from which he earned his B.A. and M.A. in philosophy in 1967 and 1969, respectively.<\/p><p>Following his graduation from his home city university, Singer enrolled at the University of Oxford, earning his B. Phil. degree from the school in 1971. Singer remained at Oxford the next two years, working as a Radcliffe Lecturer in Philosophy at University College.<\/p><p>Singer's time in England proved instrumental. There, he became committed to vegetarianism. His affiliation with the cause led to his controversial and well-known publication <em>Animal Liberation: A New Ethics for Our Treatment of Animals<\/em> in 1975.<\/p><p>The work's publication articulated a careful argument that gave moral standing to animals. It also drew greater awareness to abuses at factory farms and scientific research, while also helping to lay the groundwork for other debates around stem-cell research and third-trimester abortions.<\/p><p>In addition, it pointed Singer on a path of activism that has touched a range of causes, from environmentalism and women's rights, to anti-war causes and civil rights.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"controversial-figure\"><h2>Controversial Figure<\/h2><p>Singer's willingness to wade deep into controversial topics has made him a lightning rod for groups around the world. Driving much of his work is his own embrace of utilitarianism, an ethical philosophy that holds that the best actions are those that maximize happiness and reduce suffering.<\/p><p>Throughout his long career, Singer has been a strong proponent of eliminating poverty, arguing that anyone who has more than they need should be giving to those in need.<\/p><p>In what some consider his most controversial work, <em>Practical Ethics<\/em> (1979), Singer looked closely at why and how a living being's interests should be valued. The work tackled a number of hot-button topics as Singer evaluated the philosophical and ethical underpinnings behind sex discrimination, animal welfare, foreign aid and abortion.<\/p><p>Among pro-life activists in particular, Singer has proven to be a popular target. His belief that newborns should not be considered a person until 30 days after their birth, and his allowance that physicians should have the right to kill some disabled babies, has drawn condemnation from anti-abortion leaders from around the world.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"princeton-appointment\"><h2>Princeton Appointment<\/h2><p>In 1999, Princeton University came under heavy fire for its appointment of Singer as the DeCamp Professor at the Center for Human Values.<\/p><p>Princeton's president, Harold Shapiro, stood his ground and quickly defended the decision. \"His books, including Animal Liberation and Practical Ethics, have been translated into 15 languages and have been widely taught in ethics classes throughout Europe and the United States, including here at Princeton,\" wrote Shapiro. \"He is a gifted teacher, whose clarity and originality have made ethical issues come alive to a broad intellectual audience.\"<\/p><p>With all the controversy, however, has come praise. In 2004 Singer was honored as the Australian Humanist of the Year. Not long after, <em>Time<\/em> magazine named Singer to its list of the world's 100 most influential people. In June 2012, Singer was also named a Companion of the Order of Australia for his work in philosophy and bioethics.<\/p><\/section>","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396417826,"id":"ci01a33b79f5ea860e","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Peter-Singer-39994-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01a33b79f5ea860e","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE4MDAzNDEwMjQ0NTAzMDU0","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T05:50:28Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":186112,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:37:50Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a87e1d5671860f","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Australia","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396413643,"id":"ci01ac7ce9c159860c","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"J-Robin-Warren-37267-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01ac7ce9c159860c","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE5NTU2MzE1ODYwOTI4MDEx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:40:44Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":64967,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:birth_country","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:40:48Z","disqusId":"f5df8c74-ba20-11e3-a9ad-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:37:50Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:40:48Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci01ac7ce9c159860c","path":"/people/groups/born-in-australia","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"born-in-australia","displayName":"Australia","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous

La Follette was an American Republican and politician who is best known as a proponent of progressivism and a fierce opponent to corporate power. He served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Governor of Wisconsin and a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin during his career. He also ran for President of the United States in 1924.<\/p><h2>Early Life<\/h2><p>“Fighting Bob La Follette” was born Robert Marion La Follette in Dane County, Wisconsin, on June 14, 1855. He worked as a farm laborer before entering the University of Wisconsin in 1875. Graduating four years later, La Follette was admitted to the Wisconsin bar in 1880. He married his college sweetheart, Belle Case, on December 31, 1881.<\/p><p>Robert La Follette launched his political career as Dane County District Attorney in 1881 in spite of objections from Republican bosses who felt his ideas were too progressive.  In 1884, he was elected to Congress, but generally voted the “Party Line” on most issues. In 1890, he was defeated in the Democrat election landslide and returned to Madison, Wisconsin to practice law. <\/p><h2>Declaration of War against Political Corruption<\/h2><p>His hiatus from politics didn’t last long. In 1891, U.S. Senator Philetus Sawyer, the state’s Republican leader, offered La Follette a bribe to fix a court case. La Follette was furious and declared war on the party machine denouncing the use of money to reverse the will of the people.  For the next ten years, La Follette traveled the state speaking out against the influence of powerful business interests and the corrupt politicians. Though he lost elections for governor in 1896 and 1898, he became a political celebrity with this outgoing personality and extraordinary flair for zealous oratory. <\/p><p>Finally, in 1900, Robert La Follette was elected governor of Wisconsin. In his first two terms he pushed several Progressive initiatives, but nearly all were blocked by the state legislature. Instituting a system later known as the “Wisconsin Idea”, he commissioned leading political science academics to help create a “laboratory of democracy” drafting bills and administering state agencies. Another effective tool he used was publically reading the “roll call” of votes state legislators to show citizen how their representatives were voting on key issues. The threat of exposing legislators’ votes for special interests helped and get many of La Follette’s reforms passed. <\/p><h2>Crusading U.S. Senator <\/h2><p>In 1906, Robert La Follette resigned as governor and was elected to the U.S. Senate. La Follette won instant fame as a Senator not controlled by special interests. Over the next eight years he pushed for dismantling the business trusts, supporting environmental protection, protecting labor unions right to strike, and the 17 Amendment allowing for direct election of U.S. Senators. In 1909, he and his wife Belle founded La Follette’s Weekly magazine (later called The Progressive) which campaigned for woman’s suffrage, racial equality, and other progressive causes. <\/p><p>Seriously considered a presidential candidate in 1912, Robert La Follette was passed over by the Republican Party when Theodore Roosevelt entered the race. Bitterly disappointed, La Follette supported Woodrow Wilson’s election and his early neutrality policies. He adamantly opposed America’s entry into World War I. After the war, he campaigned against the Treaty of Versailles and U.S. membership in the League of Nations. Critics declared his war opposition political suicide, but he was reelected to the Senate in 1922.<\/p><h2>Final Act<\/h2><p>  Convinced the war had given big business too much influence in government, Robert La Follette began exposing flagrant corruption. Between 1921 and 1924 he played a prominent role in exposing the Tea Pot Dome scandals. With the support of farm groups, labor organizations and the Socialist Party, Robert La Follette ran for president in 1924, but lost to Calvin Coolidge. The experiences exhausted him both physically and spiritually.  He died the following year on June 18, 1925 of cardiovascular disease. After his death, his wife, Belle, and two sons, Robert Jr. and Philip carried on his legacy. Both sons entered politics as Progressives with Philip playing a prominent role in Wisconsin politics as governor and Robert, Jr. taking his father’s seat in the US Senate.&nbsp;<\/p><\/section><div tml-anchor=\"image-robert-m-la-follette-40226-2-raw\">\n    <div tml-image=\"ci01a33b79f649860e\" tml-image-caption=\"\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div>\n<\/div>","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396418163,"id":"ci01ac7ce9c6b2860c","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Robert-M-La-Follette-40226-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01ac7ce9c6b2860c","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE4MDAzNDEwMjUwOTI1NTgy","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T05:56:04Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":101404,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a33b79f056860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"United States","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396412473,"id":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"William-Atherton-4822-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE1ODA0OTcxMjQ2ODQ3NTAx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:14Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":76197,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:birth_country","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","disqusId":"3c2c2230-ba1e-11e3-9706-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","path":"/people/groups/born-in-united-states","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"born-in-united-states","displayName":"United States","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous People Born in United States","primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","statusCode":"complete"},"bestKnownFor":"Robert M.

","editedTimestamp":"2014-09-29T14:24:03Z","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","profileTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><section tml-anchor=\"synopsis\"><h2>Synopsis<\/h2><p>Bill Ayers, educator and activist, was born in Oak Park, Illinois. During his undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan, Ayers became involved with the Students for a Democratic Society(SDS) and the movement to end the war in Vietnam. He and several others founded the Weather Underground, believing the anti-war movement needed to use violence, if necessary, to achieve its goals.  <\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-life\"><h2>Early Life<\/h2><p>Activist, educator, author, member of the Weathermen (later known as  the Weather Underground). Born William Charles Ayers on December 26,  1944, in Oak Park, Illinois. A former radical activist, Bill Ayers has  established himself as an educator and author. He grew up as the middle  child of five in the Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn. His father was a  business executive and his mother was a homemaker.<\/p><p>As a high  school junior, Ayers was sent to Lake Forest Academy, a prep school  north of Chicago. He joined his older brother Tim to University of  Michigan in Ann Arbor after graduating from the academy. At the  university, Ayers became politically active, joining the Students for a  Democratic Society (SDS), which sought social and political change and  opposed U.S. involvement in Vietnam. He took a break from college to  work at an experimental private school in Ann Arbor in 1965 and then  moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to help with a new school there. Returning to  the university, Ayers continued to be involved in political and social  causes, especially the anti-war movement. He graduated in 1968 with a  bachelor’s degree in American studies.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"the-weathermen\"><h2>The Weathermen<\/h2><p>After college, Ayers  devoted much of his time to his activism. He was among the demonstrators  at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Developing a more militant  version of the SDS, Ayers helped found the Weathermen the following  year. The group thought more drastic measures were needed to end the war  in Vietnam. In October 1969, the Weathermen took to the streets in what  was called the “Days of Rage” protests. The event started off with the  bombing of a statue in Chicago’s Haymarket Square and then erupted into a  clash between the group members and the police. During the conflict,  287 Weathermen were arrested. <\/p> <p>Later that year, the group took  responsibility for bombing several police cars in Chicago in retaliation  for the killing of Mark Clark and Fred Hampton of the Black Panther  Party by the police. By early 1970, many members of the group were in  hiding, including Ayers. The organization was rocked by tragedy in March  of that year when three members—Theodore Gold, Terry Robbins, and  Ayers’ girlfriend Diana Oughton—were killed while making bombs in New  York City.<\/p> <p>Even after these deaths, the group remained active.  Ayers participated in the 1971 bombing of the Capitol building and the  1972 bombing of the Pentagon, according to his 2001 book <em>Fugitive Days: A Memoir<\/em>.  He remained underground for a decade. While on the run, Ayers became  involved with fellow Weather Underground member Bernardine Dorhn. The  two decided to come out of hiding in 1980 after the birth of their  second child together, a son named Malik. (Their older son Zayd was born  in 1977.)<\/p> <p>Federal charges against Ayers and Dohrn were dismissed because of “improper surveillance,” according to an article in the <em>Chicago Sun-Times<\/em>.  Ayers returned to school to study early childhood education at Bank  Street College of Education and received his master’s degree in 1984.  Staying on there, he worked as an instructor while working on a  doctorate in curriculum and teaching, which he completed in 1987. Ayers  joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1992. In  addition to his work at the university, he has become an accomplished  author, writing numerous works on education, including <em>The Good Preschool Teacher: Six Teachers Reflect on Their Lives<\/em> (1989), <em>To Teach: The Journey of a Teacher<\/em> (1993), and <em>Teaching for Social Justice: A Democracy and Education Reader<\/em> (1998).   <\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"media-attention-during-the-2008-elections\"><h2>Media Attention During the 2008 Elections<\/h2><p>During the 2008 presidential campaign, Ayers found  himself in the midst of media maelstrom. His connection to Democratic  candidate Barack Obama became an issue brought up by John McCain’s  campaign, which made automated calls to voters in several states,  including Nevada and Wisconsin. The message, in part, said that Obama  “has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose  organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge’s home and  killed Americans,” according to an Associated Press report.<\/p> <p>Obama  and Ayers have known each other for years. Ayers and Dohrn hosted an  event for Obama at their house in the mid-1990s during Obama’s first  campaign for the Illinois Senate. They both have worked with two  non-profit groups, the Woods Fund of Chicago and Chicago Anneberg  Challenge, over the years. They have not been in contact with each  other, however, since 2005 excluding one chance encounter in their  shared neighborhood in 2007, according to a report in <em>The New York Times<\/em>.  \"The suggestion that Ayers was a political adviser to Obama or someone  who shaped his political views is patently false,\" said Obama campaign  spokesperson Ben LaBolt to <em>The New York Times<\/em>.     <\/p> <p>Ayers,  a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is on sabbatical  for the 2008-2009 academic year. He lives in Chicago’s Hyde Park  neighborhood with Bernardine Dohrn.<\/p> <\/section>","birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a33b79f056860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"United States","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396412473,"id":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"William-Atherton-4822-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE1ODA0OTcxMjQ2ODQ3NTAx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:14Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":76197,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:birth_country","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","disqusId":"3c2c2230-ba1e-11e3-9706-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","path":"/people/groups/born-in-united-states","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"born-in-united-states","displayName":"United States","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous People Born in United States","primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","statusCode":"complete"},"bestKnownFor":"Bill Ayers is best known for his involvement with the Weather Underground, a militant group created to end the Vietnam War.

He went to university and became a professor, but suffered a mental breakdown in 1897 that left him unable to work for five years. In 1905 he published his most famous work, <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism<\/em>. He returned to teaching in 1918 and died in 1920. He is considered the father of modern sociology.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-life-and-education\"><h2>Early Life and Education<\/h2><p>Max Weber was born on April 21, 1864. His father, Max Weber Sr., was a politically active lawyer with a penchant for “earthly pleasures,” while his mother, Helene Fallenstein Weber, preferred a more ascetic lifestyle. The conflicts this created in their marriage acutely influenced Max. Still, their house was full of prominent intellectuals and lively discourse, an environment in which Weber thrived. Growing up, he was bored with school and disdained his teachers, but devoured classic literature on his own.<\/p> <p>After graduating from high school, Weber studied law, history, philosophy and economics for three semesters at Heidelberg University before spending a year in the military. When he resumed his studies in 1884, he went to the University of Berlin and spent one semester at Göttingen. He passed the bar exam in 1886 and earned his Ph.D. in 1889, ultimately completing his habitation thesis, which allowed him to obtain a position in academia.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-career\"><h2>Early Career<\/h2><p>Weber married a distant cousin, Marianne Schnitger, in 1893. He got a job teaching economics at Freiburg University the following year, before returning to Heidelberg in 1896 as a professor. In 1897, Max had a falling out with his father, which went unresolved. After his father died in 1897, Weber suffered a mental breakdown. He was plagued by depression, anxiety and insomnia, which made it impossible for him to teach. He spent the next five years in and out of sanatoriums.<\/p> <p>When Weber was finally able to resume working in 1903, he became an editor at a prominent social science journal. In 1904, he was invited to deliver a lecture at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis, Missouri and later became widely known for his famed essays, <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism<\/em>. These essays, published in 1904 and 1905, discussed his idea that the rise of modern capitalism was attributable to Protestantism, particularly Calvinism.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"later-work\"><h2>Later Work<\/h2><p>After a stint volunteering in the medical service during World War I, Weber published three more books on religion in a sociological context. These works, <em>The Religion of China<\/em> (1916), <em>The Religion of India<\/em> (1916) and <em>Ancient Judaism<\/em> (1917-1918), contrasted their respective religions and cultures with that of the Western world by weighing the importance of economic and religious factors, among others, on historical outcomes. Weber resumed teaching in 1918. He intended to publish additional volumes on Christianity and Islam, but he contracted the Spanish flu and died in Munich on June 14, 1920.

The documents contained evidence that the U.S. government had misled the public regarding U.S. involvement in the war.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-life\"><h2>Early Life<\/h2><p>Military analyst Daniel Ellsberg was born on April 7, 1931, in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Highland Park, Michigan. His father, Harry Ellsberg, worked as a civil engineer and his mother, Adele, worked as a fundraiser at the National Jewish Hospital but quit working upon her marriage. Both of Ellsberg's parents were Jewish by heritage but fervent converts to Christian Science. Neighbors and classmates remember young Daniel Ellsberg as an introverted and unusual child.<\/p> <p>\"Danny was just never one of the guys,\" one classmate recalled. \"He wasn't like the rest of the boys.\" Another neighbor recalled: \"I don't think we walked to school with him ever. He never fraternized with any of the young people in the neighborhood.\" However, Ellsberg was also an extraordinarily gifted child, excelling especially at math and piano. He read constantly and possessed phenomenal recall, once appearing on a Detroit radio station to recite the entire Gettysburg Address from memory.<\/p> <p>Ellsberg received a full academic scholarship to attend the prestigious Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, just outside Detroit, Michigan, ultimately graduating first in his class in 1948 and thus earning another full academic scholarship to study at Harvard. There he majored in economics and wrote a senior honors thesis entitled \"Theories of Decision-making Under Uncertainty: The Contributions of von Neumann and Morgenstern,\" which he later developed into journal articles published in the <em>Economic Journal<\/em> and <em>American Economics Review<\/em>.<\/p> <p>Upon graduating from Harvard summa cum laude in 1952, Ellsberg received a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship to study economics for a year at King's College, Cambridge University. He returned to the United States in 1953 and immediately volunteered to serve in the Marine Corps Officer Candidates Program (he had earlier been granted educational deferments of military service). Ellsberg served in the Marine Corps for three years, from 1954-'57, working as rifle platoon leader, operations officer and rifle company commander. He extended his service for six months to serve in the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean during the 1956 Suez Crisis in Egypt.<\/p> <p>After completing his military service, Ellsberg returned to Harvard on a three-year Junior Fellowship with the Society of Fellows to pursue independent graduate study in economics. In 1959, he landed a position as strategic analyst at the RAND Corporation, a highly influential nonprofit that closely advised the U.S. government on military strategy. After first working as a consultant to the Commander-in-Chief Pacific, in 1961 he was assigned to draft the Secretary of Defense Guidance to the Joint Chiefs of Staff on operational plans in the event of a nuclear war.<\/p> <p>When the Cuban Missile Crisis unfolded a year later, Ellsberg was immediately summoned to Washington, D.C. to serve on the various working groups reporting to the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. That same year he completed his Ph.D. in economics at Harvard with a thesis titled \"Risk, Ambiguity and Decision.\" He published an article presenting his findings in the Quarterly Journal of Economics that popularized the concept now dubbed the \"Ellsberg Paradox,\" exploring situations in which people's choices violate the expected utility hypothesis.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"government-service-and-pentagon-papers\"><h2>Government Service and Pentagon Papers<\/h2><p>In 1964, Ellsberg went to work for the Department of Defense as a  Special Assistant to Assistant Secretary of Defense for International  Security Affairs John T. McNaughton. In a fateful coincidence, his first  day of work at the Pentagon, August 4, 1964, was the day of the alleged  second attack (which in fact did not occur) on the USS Maddox in the  Tonkin Gulf off the coast of Vietnam&mdash;an incident that provided much of  the public justification for full-scale American intervention in the  Vietnam War.<\/p> <p>Ellsberg's primary responsibility for the Defense  Department was to craft secret plans to escalate the war in Vietnam&mdash;plans he says he personally regarded as \"wrongheaded and dangerous\" and  hoped would never be carried out. Nevertheless, when President Lyndon  Johnson chose to ramp up American involvement in the conflict in 1965,  Ellsberg moved to Vietnam to work out of the American Embassy in Saigon  evaluating pacification efforts along the front lines. He eventually  left Vietnam in June 1967 after contracting hepatitis.<\/p> <p>Returning to the RAND Corporation later that year, Ellsberg worked on a  top-secret report ordered by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara entitled  U.S. Decision-making in Vietnam, 1945-1968. Better known as \"The  Pentagon Papers,\" the final product was a 7,000-page, 47-volume study  that Ellsberg called \"evidence of a quarter century of aggression,  broken treaties, deceptions, stolen elections, lies and murder.\"  Although he worked as a consultant on Vietnam policy to new President  Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger throughout 1969,  Ellsberg grew increasingly frustrated with their insistence on expanding  upon previous administrations' policies of escalation and deception in  Vietnam.<\/p> <p>Inspired by a young Harvard graduate named Randy Kehler who  worked with the War Resisters League and was imprisoned for refusing to  cooperate with the military draft&mdash;as well as by reading Thoreau,  Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King&mdash;Ellsberg decided to end what he saw  as his complicity with the Vietnam War and start working to bring about  its end. He recalled, \"Their example put the question in my head: What  could I do to help shorten this war, now that I'm prepared to go to  prison for it?\"<\/p> <p>In late 1969, with the help of former RAND colleague Anthony Russo, Ellsberg began secretly photocopying the entire Pentagon Papers. He privately offered the Papers to several congressmen including the influential J. William Fulbright, but none was willing to make them public or hold hearings about them. So in March 1971 Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers to the <em>New York Times<\/em>, which began publishing them three months later.<\/p> <p>When the Times was slapped with an injunction ordering a stop to publication, Ellsberg provided the Pentagon Papers to the <em>Washington Post<\/em> and then to 15 other newspapers. The case, entitled New York Times Co. v. The United States, ultimately went all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which on June 30, 1971 issued a landmark 6-3 decision authorizing the newspapers to print the Pentagon Papers without risk of government censure.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"life-as-a-whistleblower\"><h2>Life as a Whistleblower<\/h2><p>Not specifically because Ellsberg released the Pentagon Papers&mdash;which covered only the period up to 1968 and therefore did not implicate the Nixon administration&mdash;but rather because they feared, incorrectly, that Ellsberg possessed documents concerning Nixon's secret plans to escalate the Vietnam War (including contingency plans involving the use of nuclear weapons), Nixon and Kissinger embarked on a fanatical campaign to discredit him. An FBI agent named G. Gordon Liddy and a CIA operative named Howard Hunt&mdash;a duo dubbed \"the Plumbers\"&mdash;wiretapped Ellsberg's phone and broke into the office of his psychiatrist, Dr. Lewis Fielding, searching for materials with which to blackmail Ellsberg. Similar \"dirty tricks\" by \"the Plumbers\" eventually led to Nixon's downfall in the Watergate scandal.<\/p> <p>For leaking the Pentagon Papers, Ellsberg was charged with theft, conspiracy and violations of the Espionage Act, but his case was dismissed as a mistrial when evidence surfaced about the government-ordered wiretappings and break-ins.<\/p> <p>Ever since his leak of the Pentagon Papers, Ellsberg has remained active as a scholar and antiwar, anti-nuclear weapons activist. He has authored three books: <em>Papers on the War<\/em><em> <\/em>(1971), <em>Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers<\/em> (2002) and <em>Risk, Ambiguity and Decision<\/em> (2001) as well as countless articles on economics, foreign policy and nuclear disarmament. In 2006, he received the Right Livelihood Award, known as the \"Alternative Nobel Prize,\" \"for putting peace and truth first, at considerable personal risk, and dedicating his life to inspiring others to follow his example.\"<\/p> <p>Daniel Ellsberg is married to Patricia Marx Ellsberg. He has three children and five grandchildren.<\/p> <p>When he chose to leak the Pentagon Papers in 1971, many people both within and outside the government derided him as a traitor and suspected him of espionage. Since that time, however, many have come to regard Daniel Ellsberg as hero of uncommon bravery, a man who risked his career and even his personal freedom to help expose the deception of his own government in carrying out the Vietnam War.<\/p> <p>The debate surrounding Ellsberg's leaking of the Pentagon Papers has recently regained international attention as historical context for the debate over the decision of Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, to leak hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies around the world. Ellsberg is an active and outspoken supporter of Assange's efforts. Ellsberg also remains fiercely proud of his decision to leak the Pentagon Papers, which he says not only deligitimized the Vietnam War, but also helped usher in a new era of skepticism about war and government in general.<\/p> <p>\"The Pentagon Papers definitely contributed to a delegitimation of the war, an impatience with its continuation, and a sense that it was wrong,\" Ellsberg said. \"They made people understand that presidents lie all the time, not just occasionally, but all the time.

He wrote hits like \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\" and \"Turn, Turn, Turn,\" which have since been recorded by several other artists. Seeger was also an engaged activist, supporting such causes as international disarmament, civil rights and environmental awareness. For his established career as a musician and activist, Seeger received three musical Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, among various other honors, during his lifetime. He died at age 94 on January 27, 2014, in New York City.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-life\"><h2>Early Life<\/h2><p>American folk icon Peter Seeger was born in New York City on May 3, 1919, into a family of musicians. His father, Charles Seeger, taught music for some time at the University of California, Berkeley; and his mother, Constance (de Clyver Edson) Seeger, taught violin at the Juilliard School. Seeger's brother, Mike, would eventually become a member of New Lost City Ramblers; his sister, Peggy, would become a performing folk musician, alongside Ewan McColl.<\/p> <p>A precocious child, Seeger was well-read and began developing political and social ideas at an early age. After receiving an early education at Avon Old Farms, a Connecticut boarding school, Seeger enrolled at Harvard University on a scholarship in 1936. After only two years at Harvard, however, he failed an exam and lost his scholarship, so he dropped out. He spent the rest of the 1930s as a vagabond, hitchiking and riding on freight trains around the country.<\/p> <p>During this time, Seeger also focused on writing music. By 1940, he had organized a folk quartet called the Almanac Singers, which frequently featured Seeger's friend and fellow folk musician, Woody Guthrie. The Almanac Singers released several albums in the early '40s. In 1942, however, the group's musical progress was stopped short: Seeger was drafted into the Army to aid the country in battle during World War II, and the group disbanded not long after.<\/p> <p>In 1943, Seeger married Toshi Aline Ohta, whom he'd met at a dance in the late 1930s.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"musical-career\"><h2>Musical Career<\/h2><p>After the war ended, in 1945, Pete Seeger went back to his musical career, performing folk songs and helping found the magazine <em>Sing Out!<\/em> A few years later, in 1948, he formed the Weavers, which included Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman. The group produced several albums of standard folk songs in the early 1950s&mdash;among them \"On Top of Old Smoky,\" \"Follow the Drinking Gourd\" and \"The Wreck of the John B\"&mdash;and even appeared in a 1951 film musical, <em>Disc Jockey<\/em>. The band also wrote and recorded several original songs, including \"If I Had a Hammer\" (1949) and \"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine\" (1950).<\/p> <p>The Weavers' success was halted, however, when speculation rose regarding Seeger's leftist political ideals, culminating with the band's designation as a Communist group by FBI informant Harvey Matusow (who later retracted his statement). The Weavers took a short break from 1952 to 1955&mdash;caused in large part by the negative press&mdash;and Seeger broke from the band in 1958. The group officially disbanded in 1962.<\/p> <p>The negative press surrounding Seeger and his politics deepened in 1961, when he was convicted for contempt of Congress&mdash;a judgment that was based on earlier questioning by the House Committee on Un-American Activities regarding Seeger's political activities as well as his subsequent and repeated refusal to answer to those claims. Seeger's musical career seemed even less promising following the conviction, which would be overturned in an appeal in 1962.<\/p> <p>Despite the controversy surrounding him, Seeger continued to perform and record as a solo artist during this time, producing such hit songs as \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone\" (1961) and \"Turn, Turn, Turn\" (1962), which was later released as a single by folk-rock group the Byrds on their album <em>Turn! Turn! Turn! <\/em>(1965).&nbsp;<\/p> <p>Also during this period, Seeger participated in the civil rights and anti-war movements of the '60s, and his reputation gradually improved. In 1966, Seeger recorded an anti-war anthem, \"Bring 'Em Home,\" including lyrics in opposition to the Vietnam War: \"For defense you need common sense/ Bring them home, bring them home/ They don't have the right armaments/ Bring them home, bring them home.\"  The song was later covered by Bruce Springsteen.<\/p> <p>His political activism bolstered Seeger's reputation as a college-campus icon and revered American folk musician. Following the release of several albums in the '60s, including <em>God Bless The Grass<\/em> and <em>Dangerous Songs!?<\/em> (both in 1966), Seeger published a literary, historical piece about folk music, civil rights and performers from the 20th century called <em>The Incompleat Folksinger<\/em> (1972).<\/p> <p>Throughout the rest of the '70s and into the '80s, the musician frequently performed with fellow folk singer-songwriter Arlo Guthrie, the son of folk legend Woody Guthrie. Also during this time, Seeger worked with other activists to remove pollution from the Hudson River and create the environmental organization Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, which, among many projects, hosts music festivals to help fund the river's maintenance.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"later-years-and-legacy\"><h2>Later Years and Legacy<\/h2><p>Seeger is regarded as a 20th century icon today, for his political activism as well as his pivotal role in the 1960s American folk  music revival. According to the <em>Encyclopedia of Folk, Country, and Western Music<\/em>,  Seeger was a \"father figure whose contributions as an artist and writer  were highly valued by people of all ages in and out of the music  field.\"<\/p> <p>Seeger received several high honors in the 1990s. In 1993, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was awarded a National Medal of Arts a year later, and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Following the release of his 1996 album, <em>Pete<\/em>, Seeger won a Grammy Award for best traditional folk album. That same year, he published an autobiography entitled <em>Where Have All the Flowers Gone<\/em>.<\/p> <p>Nearly a decade later, Seeger received his third Grammy Award&mdash;this time for best traditional album&mdash;for his 2008 release, <em>At 89<\/em>. Also in 2008, the folk icon performed at President Barack Obama's inaugural celebration. In 2010, at the age of 91, Seeger released the abum <em>Tomorrow's Children<\/em>, which he recorded with a group of students and dedicated to environmental awareness. The work garnered him his fourth Grammy Award, for best musical album for children.<\/p> <p>In his later years, Seeger continued to work as an activist, supporting such causes as international disarmament, civil rights  and environmental awareness. His wife, Toshi, passed away at the age of 91 on July 9, 2013&mdash;just days before the couple's 70th wedding anniversary&mdash;at their Beacon, New York, home. Seeger died months later, on January 27, 2014, at the age of 94, at New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. The legendary musician was survived by son Daniel, daughters Mika and Tinya, half-sister Peggy and six grandchildren.<\/p><\/section>","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396467819,"id":"ci01ac7ce9e699860c","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Pete-Seeger-9542618-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01ac7ce9e699860c","hasFaces":false,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE5NTU2MzE2NDczMzYxOTMx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T19:43:41Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":173495,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a33b79f056860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"United States","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396412473,"id":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"William-Atherton-4822-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE1ODA0OTcxMjQ2ODQ3NTAx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:14Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":76197,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:birth_country","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","disqusId":"3c2c2230-ba1e-11e3-9706-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","path":"/people/groups/born-in-united-states","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"born-in-united-states","displayName":"United States","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous People Born in United States","primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","statusCode":"complete"},"bestKnownFor":"Pete Seeger was an iconic singer-songwriter best known for his contributions to the American folk music revival and his political activism.","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T19:43:48Z","groups":[{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T03:54:18Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"metaDescription":"Explore our collection of Folk Singers and Folk Revolutionaries on Biography.com, including Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and more.","id":"ci01a33b79ef59860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Folk Singers and Folk Revolutionaries","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"altText":"Folk Singers and Folk Revolutionaries: Woody Guthrie strikes one of his signature contemplative poses, guitar in hand, in New York City in the early 1940s.

1959, after Walk of Fame recording executives compiled a list of industry leaders who they realized would never get a star on Hollywood Boulevard, but deserved recognition.

born in Flint, Michigan on April 23, 1954. He started in print journalism and was briefly the editor of Mother Jones magazine. His debut film, Roger & Me, became the highest-grossing American documentary of all time. Moore had a short-lived political series called TV Nation and his film Bowling for Columbine, won an Academy Award. Moore lives in Traverse City, Michigan.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"roger-&-me\"><h2>Roger & Me<\/h2><p>Writer, director, actor, political activist. Born in Flint, Michigan.  Moore burst onto the American cultural scene in the 1980s, a chubby,  extroverted rabble-rouser who hitched his political message to the  medium of satirical comedy in a crusade to rouse the national conscience  against corporate injustice. A genuine subversive, he made his impact  with his debut film, <em>Roger & Me<\/em> (1989), a satirical  documentary feature that chronicled his attempts to interview the CEO of  General Motors, Roger Smith. Moore wrote, directed and starred in the  film, which became the highest-grossing American documentary of all  time.<\/p><p>Critical opinion was high but divided. The <em>Washington Post<\/em> described <em>Roger & Me<\/em>  as a \"hilariously cranky bit of propaganda\" and critics such as Roger  Ebert gave it rave reviews, but others, including the doyenne of the <em>New Yorker,<\/em> Pauline Kael, attacked Moore for re-arranging the narrative events of the movie. He responded in an interview in <em>Film Comment<\/em>  that \"the movie is essentially what has happened to this town [Flint]  during the 1980s. I wasn't filming in 1982 ... so everything that  happened happened. As far as I'm concerned, a period of seven or eight  years ... is pretty immediate and pretty devastating.... I think it's a  document about a town that died in the 1980s.\" The critical controversy  notwithstanding, the film was voted Best Documentary by the National  Board of Review, the New York Film Critics, the Los Angeles Film  Critics, and the National Society of Film Critics, as well as Best Film  at the Toronto, Vancouver, and Chicago Film Festivals. It was included  on several critics' \"best of the decade\" lists, but conspicuously failed  even to be nominated for an Academy Award. <em>Roger & Me<\/em> was  creatively financed by Moore and his friends through bingo games and  other fund raising efforts, but also through an out of court settlement  Moore made with <em>Mother Jones<\/em> magazine over his dismissal from the publication after a short tenure as editor in 1986-87.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"background\"><h2>Background<\/h2><p>Moore came to <em>Mother Jones<\/em> after a successful career as an  alternative journalist in his hometown of Flint, Michigan (though he is  actually from the suburb of Davison). Moore's comedy and politics  emerged from his roots in a working-class community that enjoyed a boom  from manufacturing automobiles at a dozen General Motors factories until  the company abandoned the town, as chronicled in <em>Roger & Me.<\/em> Moore had been a staunch opponent of GM and local Flint politics since founding the <em>Flint Voice<\/em>  at the age of 22. He partially funded the newspaper through the weekly  showing of alternative movies, and promoted it through work on the local  public radio station where he hosted a show called \"Radio Free Flint.\"  He also wrote essays for National Public Radio. A rabble rouser from  early on, Moore was elected to his local school board at age 18 and  successfully fought to have its meetings open to the public.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"michael-moores-voice\"><h2>Michael Moore's Voice<\/h2><p>Moore followed up <em>Roger & Me<\/em> with a sequel, <em>Pets or Meat: A Return to Flint<\/em>  (1992) a short film shown on PBS. The second film repeated the narrated  style of the first and seemed more of a continuation than a sequel. In  it, Moore caught up on the lives of people from the first film,  including \"the Rabbit Lady,\" who sold rabbits as pets or meat. The film  was also an update on Moore himself, containing snippets from his  appearances on television talk shows such as Donahue<em>.<\/em> He made an  unlikely movie \"star\"—he is heavyset with a goofy grin, a fondness for  baseball caps, and a preference untucked shirts—yet there is no doubt  that the \"star\" of all of Moore's films is Michael Moore.<\/p><p>His next project was a narrative film, <em>Canadian Bacon<\/em>  (1994), starring John Candy, Rhea Perlman, Kevin Pollack, Alan Alda,  and Rip Torn. Alda plays a liberal U.S. president who decides to invade  Canada in order to boost his popularity in the polls. A cross between <em>Dr. Strangelove<\/em> (there's a similar Doomsday device) and <em>Wag the Dog<\/em>  (the invasion of a foreign country for shabby domestic reasons), the  film never received wide release, nor were the reviews particularly  enthusiastic.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"television-and-books\"><h2>Television and Books<\/h2><p>Moore's next move was to take the basic <em>Roger & Me<\/em> idea—good guy Mike harasses evil corporate America—to television. His political comedy show, <em>TV Nation<\/em>,  was a summer replacement on NBC in 1994. The show featured weekly,  off-the-wall polls like 16% of Perot voters believe that \"if dolphins  are really that smart they could get out of those nets,\" and showcased  memorable events such as a day of picnicking with \"Doctor Death\" Jack  Kevorkian. The first episode featured the \"CEO Challenge\" in which he  asked executives to perform menial tasks, such as getting the head of  IBM to format a disk. While not all the stories had a political bent, <em>TV Nation<\/em> was an eclectic mix of news magazine, sketch comedy, and David Letterman-style comedy of the banal. Only on <em>TV Nation<\/em>  would you see a guy in a Detroit Tigers baseball cap attempting to end  the conflict in Bosnia by getting leaders from the warring factions to  share a pizza together.<\/p><p>NBC passed on <em>TV Nation<\/em>, but Fox  picked it up for eight episodes in the summer of 1995. It was more of  the same, including a segment featuring Moore performing maneuvers with  the Michigan Militia. He also introduced Crackers, the corporate  crime-fighting chicken, alongside featured guests such as Merrill Markoe  (David Letterman's former chief writer), actress and stand-up comedian  Janeane Garofalo, former MTV VJ Karen Duffy, and filmmaker Rusty  Cundieff, who wrote and directed a comedy movie, <em>Fear of a Black Hat.<\/em> Moore chronicled his experiences with the show in a book, <em>Adventures in TV Nation<\/em> (1998), written with wife Kathleen Glynn.<\/p><p>The book was not his first. He had published <em>Downsize This: Random Threats from an Unarmed American,<\/em>  an unlikely best seller, in 1994. The book began with two photos: one  of the bombed out Federal building in Oklahoma City, the other of a pile  of rubble which used to be an auto factory in Flint. The point of that  piece, and the book, is to expose, through satire, irony, and  poke-in-the-eye comedy, corporate America's war on working-class  families. With chapters such as \"Would Pat Buchanan take a check from  Satan?\" \"Why doesn't GM sell crack?\" and \"Why are Union Leaders so  f#!&ing stupid?\" the book is part stand-up comedy in printed form,  part political manifesto, and part <em>Spy<\/em> magazine-like pranks. The  author embarked on an unconventional book promotion tour, refusing to  sign books at certain chain stores and seeking out independent  booksellers. After a few stops, he was joined by a film crew, which led  to the making of his movie <em>The Big One<\/em> (1997). The film features  stunts familiar to Moore's fans, including the presentation of Downsizer  of the Year awards to company bigwigs. It opened in selected cities as  benefits for local charities, unions, and leftist political groups.  Moore would answer questions, promote local causes, tell some jokes, and  then inspire the audience to political action. Despite excellent  reviews, <em>The Big One<\/em> failed to achieve commercial success; an  angry film about corporate America seemed out of synch when the Dow was  at an all-time record high.<\/p> <\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"provocative-documentaries\"><h2>Provocative Documentaries<\/h2><p>As the twentieth century ended, Moore was still pitching his  political message to a larger audience, attempting a weekly talk show  and developing <em>Better Days<\/em> (1998), a sitcom about a town where  everybody is unemployed. In conjunction with Britain's Channel 4, he  negotiated another incarnation of <em>TV Nation,<\/em> which launched in early 1999 under the title <em>The Awful Truth.<\/em>  It kicked off with a scathing attack on health insurance companies in  the United States and a somewhat crude and gauche sideswipe at Kenneth  Starr morality in the form of a sketch delivered like a scene from  Arthur Miller's <em>The Crucible.<\/em> Moore looked set to remain a viable  force in popular culture in the twenty-first century. Virtually the  country's lone left-wing satirist, he pops up regularly on talk shows  such as <em>Politically Incorrect.<\/em> Popular culture has never seen a  figure quite like Michael Moore: a comedian who one minute offers a  critical analysis of legislation, and in the next a suggestion that  Queen's \"We Will Rock You\" become the new national anthem.<\/p><p>In 2003, Moore's <em>Bowling for Columbine<\/em>,  which took a dark-comic look at gun culture in the United Sates, won  the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The director's  acceptance speech included a very Moore-like statement against the war  with Iraq. \"We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for  fictitious reasons. We are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you!\"  The film was also awarded the Special 55th Anniversary Prize at the 2002  Cannes Film Festival. In late 2002, the director launched a one-man  stage show, <em>Michael Moore—Live<\/em>, in London and New York. In 2004, The Walt Disney Company banned Miramax from distributing Moore's documentary <em>Fahrenheit 9/11<\/em>,  which critiques the Bush administration's handling of Iraq and the war  on terror. The film won the coveted Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film  Festival and, when it eventually hit theaters in June, became the first  documentary to win the weekend box office.<\/p><\/section>","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396466377,"id":"ci01a8bfd61d3d860b","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Michael-Moore-9542483-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01a8bfd61d3d860b","hasFaces":false,"width":402,"publicId":"MTIwNjA4NjM0MDU4MjEyODc2","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T19:19:38Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":40565,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a33b79f056860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"United States","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396412473,"id":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"William-Atherton-4822-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE1ODA0OTcxMjQ2ODQ3NTAx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:14Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":76197,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:birth_country","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","disqusId":"3c2c2230-ba1e-11e3-9706-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","path":"/people/groups/born-in-united-states","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"born-in-united-states","displayName":"United States","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous People Born in United States","primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","statusCode":"complete"},"bestKnownFor":"Michael Moore is a documentary filmmaker and satirist.

A Scout is a \"trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent,\" boy who, above all,  strives to \"be prepared\" and \"do his best.\" The highest order of these Boy Scouts are the Eagle Scouts, a rare group of young men who rise through the scouting ranks to earn 21 merit badges, serve for six months in a troop leadership position, and successfully complete a strict Eagle Scout board of review, among other requirements. <p><p> The first Eagle Scout to complete this training was 17-year-old Arthur R. Eldred, on September 2, 1912. Since then, more than 2 million Boy Scouts have earned the coveted rank.

In 1955, he won his first Emmy, for writing the TV business drama <em>Patterns<\/em>. In 1959, he turned to the sci-fi fantasy genre, with <em>The Twilight Zone<\/em>. In 1968, he co-wrote the screenplay for <em>Planet of the Apes<\/em>. Serling died in Rochester, New York, on June 28, 1975. Over the course of his career, he wrote 252 scripts and won six Emmys.<\/p><\/section><section tml-anchor=\"early-years\"><h2>Early Years<\/h2><p>Television writer and producer Rod Serling was born Rodman Edward Serling on December 25, 1924, to a Jewish family in Syracuse, New York. When Serling was 2 years old, he and his family moved to the quiet college town of Binghamton, where his dad Sam opened a grocery store.<\/p><p>After graduating from Binghamton High School, Serling enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, with the aim of fighting the Nazis in Europe. Contrary to his intention, he ended up becoming a paratrooper in the Pacific theater. During the war, Serling was injured in his knee and wrist at the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines. He was sent home with a Purple Heart and emotional battle scars that would haunt him for the rest of his days.<\/p><p>To compound matters, Serling's return from the war was followed by the devastating loss of his father, who died suddenly of a heart attack. His traumatic experiences would later serve as inspiration for his writing. After the war, Serling attended Antioch College in Ohio.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"television-writer-and-producer\"><h2>Television Writer and Producer<\/h2><p>In 1948 Serling moved to New York City and entered the work world as a struggling freelance radio writer. In 1955, he branched out into television script writing with the TV business drama <em>Patterns<\/em>. <em>Patterns<\/em> earned Serling his first Emmy Award. <\/p><p>Serling's second Emmy win came a year later, with the 1956 production of <em>Requiem for a Heavyweight<\/em>, starring Jack Palance. During the late 1950s, Serling fought the CBS network when they insisted on editing his controversial scripts. CBS got its way and heavily revised his script about lynching, entitled <em>A Town Has Turned to Dust<\/em>, and another about corruption in a labor union, called <em>The Rank and File<\/em>. Instead of continuing to fight inevitable censorship, in 1959 Serling turned from realism to the sci-fi fantasy genre, with the iconic series <em>The Twilight Zone<\/em>. Not only did Serling write the series, but he was also the face of it, serving as its on-screen narrator. <em>The Twilight Zone<\/em> ran until 1964 and garnered Serling his third Emmy.<\/p><p>In 1968, Serling co-wrote the screenplay for the original movie version of <em>Planet of the Apes<\/em>. After a stint of screenwriting, he returned to television writing in 1970.<\/p><p>Serling spent his later career hosting <em>Rod Serling's Night Gallery<\/em> and teaching screenwriting at Ithaca College. Over the course of his career, Serling wrote an estimated 252 scripts and won a total of six Emmys.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"personal-life\"><h2>Personal Life<\/h2><p>While Serling worked 12 hours a day seven days a week, his wife, Carol, whom he had met at Antioch College, tended to their daughters, Jodi and Anne. Despite his demanding work schedule, Anne Serling claims in her memoir of her father, <em>As I Knew Him: My Dad, Rod Serling<\/em>, that she \"never felt the 12-hour workday,\" and always knew that if she needed to, she could go talk to him.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"later-life-and-death\"><h2>Later Life and Death<\/h2><p>In May of 1975, when he was 50 years old, Serling had a heart attack while running on a treadmill. A couple of weeks later, he had a second heart attack, at his cottage on Cayuga Lake, and was sent to the hospital for open-heart surgery. On June 28, 1975, Rod Serling died at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York.<\/p><\/section>","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396454937,"id":"ci01a87e1d7602860f","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Rod-Serling-9479196-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci01a87e1d7602860f","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE1ODA0OTcxNzgyMDE0NDc3","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T16:08:59Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":32324,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a33b79f056860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"United States","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396412473,"id":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"William-Atherton-4822-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE1ODA0OTcxMjQ2ODQ3NTAx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:14Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":76197,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:birth_country","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","disqusId":"3c2c2230-ba1e-11e3-9706-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","path":"/people/groups/born-in-united-states","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"born-in-united-states","displayName":"United States","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous People Born in United States","primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","statusCode":"complete"},"bestKnownFor":"Emmy Award&ndash;winning television and film writer Rod Serling created and hosted the sci-fi fantasy series The Twilight Zone and co-wrote Planet of the Apes.","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T16:09:06Z","groups":[{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T03:05:19Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"metaDescription":"Explore Biography's collection of Celebrity Enlistees See our picks, along with full biographies, photo galleries and videos, only on Biography.com.","id":"ci019b6c01fbf2860d","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Celebrity Enlistees","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"altText":"Celebrity Enlistees: Pro boxer Sugar Ray Robinson was inducted into the military in 1943.

Gere received acclaim for an off-Broadway appearance in <em>Killer's Head<\/em>, then made his big-screen debut with a small role in <em>Report to the Commissioner<\/em>.

He grew up in a large Methodist family, one of five children born to Homer and Doris Ann Gere. A musical child, Gere became quite skilled at playing the trumpet.<\/p> <p>After graduating from North Syracuse Central High School in 1967, Richard Gere studied philosophy at University of Massachusetts at Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship. He left school after two years to explore his interest in theater. In the early 1970s, Gere landed the role of Danny Zuko in the musical <em>Grease<\/em> in London.<\/p> <p>Gere had a career breakthrough in 1977 with the dramatic thriller <em>Looking for Mr. Goodbar<\/em>, starring Diane Keaton. In the film, he plays a rough-and-tumble lothario who meets a schoolteacher (Keaton). The following year, Gere landed a starring role in Terrence Malick's epic <em>Days of Heaven<\/em>.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"hollywoods-leading-man\"><h2>Hollywood's Leading Man<\/h2><p>Gere became an actor on the rise in the 1980s. In 1980, he had the title role in <em>American Gigolo<\/em>. Gere's character in the film is the personification of smooth and cool with his distinctive fashion style and swagger. Two years later, he came to embody the romantic lead in <em>An Officer and a Gentleman<\/em> opposite Debra Winger. Gere plays a troubled military recruit who gets involved with a local girl near his basic training camp. The drama proved to be a box office hit.<\/p> <p>In 1990, Gere enjoyed another wave of success with the romantic comedy <em>Pretty Woman<\/em>. The film follows the unlikely relationship that develops between a prostitute, played by Julia Roberts, and her client (Gere). He also showed himself capable of handling more weighty roles, such as the dirty cop in 1990's <em>Internal Affairs<\/em> and a defense attorney in <em>Primal Fear<\/em> (1996).<\/p> <p>Known for his charisma, charm and good looks, Gere earned <em>People<\/em> magazine's \"Sexiest Man Alive\" honor in 1999. He played against type for 2002's <em>Unfaithful<\/em> as Diane Lane's cuckolded husband. That same year, Gere returned to his musical theater roots with the film adaptation of the Broadway hit <em>Chicago<\/em>. He won a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of slick lawyer Billy Flynn.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"activist-actor\"><h2>Activist Actor<\/h2><p>Throughout his career, Gere has devoted much of his time to his social and political causes. The longtime Buddhist co-founded the Tibet House in 1987 and has served as the chairman of the board for the International Campaign for Tibet since 1995. He later established the Gere Foundation \"to help sponsor human rights in Tibet and support the Dalai Lama,\" Gere explained to <em>Redbook<\/em>. He also supported charities to help those suffering from AIDS, especially in India.<\/p> <p>These days Gere divides his time between his activism and his acting. He still seeks out interesting characters to play on the big screen. He starred in 2006's <em>The Hoax<\/em> as the infamous writer Clifford Irving. Irving conned the world into believing he wrote a biography of famed reclusive business mogul Howard Hughes in the 1970s. The following year, Gere appeared in <em>I'm Not There<\/em>, an experimental film about music legend Bob Dylan. He also reunited with Diane Lane for the romantic drama <em>Nights in Rodanthe<\/em> (2008) around this time.<\/p> <p>In 2009, Gere co-starred with Hilary Swank in <em>Amelia<\/em>, a biopic about groundbreaking aviator Amelia Earhart. While that film proved to be a critical and commercial disappointment, he earned raves for one of his next efforts. Gere starred in 2012's <em>Arbitrage<\/em> with Susan Sarandon, playing a troubled hedge fund titan; his stunning performance in the film earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination.<\/p><\/section> <section tml-anchor=\"personal-life\"><h2>Personal Life<\/h2><p>Gere was married to model Cindy Crawford from 1991 to 1995.<\/p> <p>In 2002, Gere wed actress Carey Lowell; they have one child together, a son named Homer. Gere and Lowell lived together in Bedford, New York, for many years. There they also co-owned the Bedford Post Inn with Russell Hernandez. In September 2013, Gere and Lowell announced that they were separating.<\/p><\/section>","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396439330,"id":"ci01ac7ce9d7eb860c","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Richard-Gere-9309229-1-402(2)","primaryPhotoId":"ci01ac7ce9d7eb860c","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE4MDAzNDEwNTM1Mjg2Mjg2","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T11:48:51Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":40599,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"birthCountry":{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01a33b79f056860e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"United States","authoringStatusCode":"in_progress","primaryImage":{"createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","height":402,"cloudinaryVersionId":1396412473,"id":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"William-Atherton-4822-1-402","primaryPhotoId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","hasFaces":true,"width":402,"publicId":"MTE1ODA0OTcxMjQ2ODQ3NTAx","format":"jpg","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:14Z","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","bytes":76197,"primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e"},"vocabularyId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e:birth_country","editedByPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","disqusId":"3c2c2230-ba1e-11e3-9706-002219604f34","originalPublicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:18:20Z","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:21:17Z","versionId":"1","primaryImageId":"ci019b6c01fe65860d","path":"/people/groups/born-in-united-states","isWorkInProgress":false,"slug":"born-in-united-states","displayName":"United States","primaryContentSiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","promoTitle":"Famous People Born in United States","primarySiteId":"cs01a33b78d5c5860e","statusCode":"complete"},"bestKnownFor":"Richard Gere is an American actor best known for his status as an American sex symbol and his leading film roles, including in Report to the Commissioner, American Gigolo, An Officer and A Gentleman, Pretty Woman and Chicago.","createdTimestamp":"2014-04-02T11:48:58Z","groups":[{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-02T04:08:38Z","createdPrincipalId":"up016bb0b82173860f","commentsEnabled":true,"metaDescription":"Anderson Cooper tops our list when it comes to Silver Foxes, but there are plenty of other famous silver-haired men—and women—out there!

A Scout is a \"trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent,\" boy who, above all,  strives to \"be prepared\" and \"do his best.\" The highest order of these Boy Scouts are the Eagle Scouts, a rare group of young men who rise through the scouting ranks to earn 21 merit badges, serve for six months in a troop leadership position, and successfully complete a strict Eagle Scout board of review, among other requirements. <p><p> The first Eagle Scout to complete this training was 17-year-old Arthur R. Eldred, on September 2, 1912. Since then, more than 2 million Boy Scouts have earned the coveted rank.

A Scout is a \"trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent,\" boy who, above all,  strives to \"be prepared\" and \"do his best.\" The highest order of these Boy Scouts are the Eagle Scouts, a rare group of young men who rise through the scouting ranks to earn 21 merit badges, serve for six months in a troop leadership position, and successfully complete a strict Eagle Scout board of review, among other requirements. <p><p> The first Eagle Scout to complete this training was 17-year-old Arthur R. Eldred, on September 2, 1912. Since then, more than 2 million Boy Scouts have earned the coveted rank.
