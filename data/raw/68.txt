The GNAD seeks a common-sense way of understanding global social constructions of race that will work for tagging so as to meet the likely needs of database readers who are searching for characteristics of the cases.

We want, for example, to assist a reader who is curious about the contention that nonviolent struggle is a white invention to find out how well-founded that belief is.

For the GNAD, the following are people of color:
Roma and Sami which are groups found in Europe among white people.
All Asia, as far west as (and including) Pakistan.  For Tajikistan, see definition of &quot;white,&quot; below.
All Sub-Saharan Africa including South African &quot;coloreds,&quot; but excluding white settler groups like the Afrikaaners in South Africa.
In Latin America as a whole: The GNAD considers &quot;Hispanic&quot; as of color everywhere except within Spain and Portugal. Note that database cases often use national designations, in campaigns for regime change, for example.  When the nation is the unit of action, as when Guatamalans overthrow their dictator, even though there are some white people in Guatemala who may have participated, the case is tagged &quot;of color&quot; because as a whole the nations of Latin America are of color.

White, for our purposes, includes Europe and European descent, including Italy, Eastern Europe/Slavic, while allowing the exceptions noted above. White also includes Turkey, Syria, the Middle East.
GNAD cases from white countries in which there is a historical range of shades of color (in contrast to recent immigration) are assumed to be white unless the campaign specifically addresses a subgroup which might be marked as &quot;colored&quot; in that cultural context, for example, Maoris campaigning in New Zealand.

Another example of application of this definition of &quot;white&quot; is the Central Asian Republics: Each of the major ethnic groups of the Central Asian Republics exhibit a broad range of skin color and facial features, for which reason they will be considered white unless the GNAD case identifies a subgroup in that campaign that is regarded, by that country&#039;s mainstream, as of color, in which case the GNAD would also regard that subgroup as of color. 

For the purposes of the GNAD, Pakistan will be the farthest west Asian country to be tagged as people of color and its northern neighbor Tajikistan will not be.

All of the historic European groups except for Roma, Sami, and other indigenous peoples will be regarded as white, including Basques and Jews.  

Hispanic will be of color everywhere except within Spain and Portugal.">(mainly or initiated by) people of color</a></li> <li class="taxonomy_term_14659 last"><a href="/category/pcs-tags/included-participation-more-one-social-class" rel="tag" title="INCLUDES PARTICIPATION BY MORE THAN ONE SOCIAL CLASS.  &quot;Class&quot; has many definitions, for example income, education, cultural rank.  The GNAD defines class by occupation.  Owning class consists of people who receive a satisfactory income from what they own and see no need to work for a living.  Their income may come from ownership of stocks, bonds, property.  This class also consists of CEOs of larger corporations and others with large incomes from what they own but who choose to work in a job anyway.  

Middle class includes teachers, nurses, computer programmers, accountants, engineers, social workers, lawyers, managers.  They have in common the economic function of managing and supervising workers, training them and grading them, keeping them functioning, and providing medium-level services and entertainment.  Within that broad category there are occupations that put people in the upper middle class: top managers, top government officials, doctors, small business owners, law partners.  These manage on a higher level (often managing other managers), they interface with other entitities/systems, they offer specialized services, guide and advise.   

Working class includes retail workers, factory workers, secretaries/clerical, miners, police, soldiers. They have in common that they produce goods and services, do day-to-day keeping track of machinery and work processes, enforce the system’s rules (like security guards).  Within the working class is the poor, with typical jobs as day labor, farm labor, dishwashers, janitorial/housekeeping, and semi-skilled criminal activity.  Their economic function is to do what few want to do and provide a surplus labor force, keeping down wages of low-wage workers.  

Farmers may be owning class, having such a lot of land that they do not actually need to work personally, or middle class, needing to manage their farms in order to generate a suitable income, or working class, formally owning their small farms but highly indebted.

We use this tag for cross-class participation that is significant or meaningful in terms of the campaign.  A random owning class member joining the audience of a labor rally would not justify the tag, but an owning class member of the executive committee of the Chamber of Commerce speaking at that same labor rally would be.  In the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory workers strike in New York City a group of owning class women joined the campaign as a visible support group, for example.">included participation by more than one social class</a></li> </ul></span> <div class="content"><span class="print-link"><span class="print_html"><a href="http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/print/content/narmada-bachao-andolan-nba-forces-end-world-bank-funding-sardar-sarovar-dam-india-1985-1993" title="Display a printer-friendly version of this page." class="print-page" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false" rel="nofollow"><img src="/sites/default/modules/print/icons/print_icon.gif" alt="Printer-friendly version" title="Printer-friendly version" width="16" height="16" class="print-icon print-icon-margin" />Printer-friendly version</a></span><span class="print_pdf"><a href="http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/printpdf/content/narmada-bachao-andolan-nba-forces-end-world-bank-funding-sardar-sarovar-dam-india-1985-1993" title="Display a PDF version of this page." class="print-pdf" rel="nofollow"><img src="/sites/default/modules/print/icons/pdf_icon.gif" alt="PDF version" title="PDF version" width="16" height="16" class="print-icon print-icon-margin" />PDF version</a></span></span><fieldset class="fieldgroup group-timing"><legend>Timing</legend><div class="field field-label field-startyear" style="float:left;"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><div class="field-label-inline-first">Time Period: &nbsp;</div></div></div></div><div class="field field-type-text field-field-timeperiodnotes"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> <div class="field-label-inline-first"> Time period notes:&nbsp;</div> This campaign focuses on World Bank involvement only; struggle against Narmada Dams, including Sardar Sarovar continues today </div> </div> </div> <div class="field field-type-text field-field-startime"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> </div> </div> </div> <div class="field field-type-number-integer field-field-startyear"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> 1985 </div> </div> </div> <div class="field field-type-text field-field-endtime"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> <div class="field-label-inline-first"> to</div> early </div> </div> </div> <div class="field field-type-number-integer field-field-endyear"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> 1993 </div> </div> </div> </fieldset> <fieldset class="fieldgroup group-loc-and-goals"><legend>Location and Goals</legend><div class="field field-type-text field-field-loc-country"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> <div class="field-label-inline-first"> Country:&nbsp;</div> India </div> </div> </div> <div class="field field-type-text field-field-city"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> <div class="field-label-inline-first"> Location City/State/Province:&nbsp;</div> Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra </div> </div> </div> <div class="field field-type-text field-field-loc-remainder"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> <div class="field-label-inline-first"> Location Description:&nbsp;</div> Narmada River Valley </div> </div> </div> <div class="field field-type-computed field-field-map-link"> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> <a href="#" class="gnad-load-full-map" rel="nid:2820">View Location on Map</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="field field-type-text field-field-goals"> <div class="field-label">Goals:&nbsp;</div> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> To halt further construction on major dams on the Narmada River, especially the Sardar Sarovar dam; demand transparency from the government and funding sources, especially the World Bank. </div> </div> </div> </fieldset> <div class="small"><a href="javascript:Drupal.FieldsetHelper.expandFieldsets('fieldset.collapsible');">Expand all</a> | <a href="javascript:Drupal.FieldsetHelper.collapseFieldsets('fieldset.collapsible');Drupal.FieldsetHelper.expandFieldsets('fieldset.group-addnotes');">Collapse all</a> </div><fieldset class="fieldgroup group-taticsfield collapsible collapsed"><legend>Methods</legend><div class="field field-type-content-taxonomy field-field-tactic1"> <div class="field-label">Methods in 1st segment:&nbsp;</div> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> <ul class="hierarchical-select-lineages"><li class="lineage-0 odd first"><span class="lineage-item lineage-item-level-0"><a href="http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/search_methods?field_alltactics_value_op=contains&field_alltactics_value=001.

The NBA and partner organizations’ principle goal was (and still is) the halting of further dam construction on the Narmada. Even though, within the time frame of this report (1985-1993), they did not halt construction, they successfully forced the World Bank to withdraw funding, a central component of the campaign up to 1993. The struggle against the Sardar Sarovar dam marks the first time that a community level opposition effectively redirected World Bank policy, leading to the formation of the World Bank Inspection Panel. However the withdrawal of the World Bank did not have the expected effect on dam construction, as the Indian government found &#039;replacement&#039; funding thereafter and continued dam construction and forced displacement. <p>Local NGOs and activist organizations quickly spread to include members of Indian middle class and liberal intellectuals. By the time of the World Bank&#039;s withdrawal, the whole world was at attention, from international economic institutions to environmental NGOs and human rights groups. NBA continues its struggle with large international support </div> </div> </div> </fieldset> <div class="line">&nbsp;</div><div class="node-content"><p id="myfirst">After the country won its independence, India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, began calling for the construction of dams to aid in India's development. Many of these dams were proposed on the Narmada River, which flows through the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra. In 1978, the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal approved the Narmada Valley Development Project, which included 30 large dams, 135 medium dams, and 3,000 small dams. The most controversial dam was the Sardar Sarovar Project in the state of Gujarat. While it was promised to supply irrigation and drinking water, costs included the forced displacement of tens of thousands of people and widespread environmental damage. </p> <p>In 1985, the World Bank agreed to finance the Sardar Sarovar dam with a contribution of $450 million without consulting the indigenous communities that were to be displaced. </p> <p>In 1987, construction began on the Sardar Sarovar dam, and the injustices of the government's relocation program were exposed: there was not enough land available for redistribution, amenities were low quality, and the settlers had difficulty adjusting to new environments. </p> <p>In response, local opponents, environmental activists, and academic, scientific and cultural professionals founded a cluster of NGOs. These NGOs allied in 1989 to form the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), or the 'Save Narmada Movement', led by Medha Patkar. Since 1985, Patkar had been organizing protest marches against the dam. </p> <p>Unlike other social justice organizations in India at the time, the NBA directly opposed dam construction altogether and proposed various development alternatives, including decentralized methods of water harvesting. They demanded World Bank accountability for the displacement of millions and initially sought to verify the claims regarding benefits of the dams. Much of the early campaign was focused on transparency from the government and World Bank. NBA employed peaceful marches, protests, and large-scale hunger fasts. They also campaigned against paying taxes and denied government officials entry into villages. </p> <p>In 1989, Lori Udall of the Environmental Defense Fund worked with a U.S. Congressional Committee to hold an oversight hearing on Sardar Sarovar, where Patkar could testify against the dam. In addition to working with the Environmental Defense Fund, the NBA would later partner with numerous other human rights, environmental, and solidarity organizations overseas, including the Narmada International Action Committee, Friends of the Earth, and Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund. </p> <p>NBA resistance operated at local, national, and international scales, redefining the terms of development, democracy, and accountability. In September 1989, Baba Amte, another prominent social activist and moral leader, led a 60,000 person anti-dam NBA rally in Harsud, a town of 20,000 in Madhya Pradesh that faced submersion. The dam site and its surrounding areas were under the Indian Official Secrets Act, which prohibited the gathering of groups of more than five people. The whole area was turned into a police camp. Despite the police barricades, one year later in 1990, thousands of villagers marched to the town of Badwani, threatening to drown in the dams rising waters rather than be relocated. The slogan, 'koi nahin hatega: bandh nahin banega!' (No one will move; the dam will not be built!) became popular. These rallies and marches helped secure the allies of the Indian middle class and liberal intellectuals, as well the attention of other countries. </p> <p>In May of 1990, NBA organized a 2,000-person, five-day sit-in at Prime Minister V. P. Singh's residence in New Delhi, which convinced the Prime Minister to 'reconsider' the project.</p> <p>In December of the same year, five to six thousand men and women began the Narmada Jan Vikas Sangharsh Yatra (Narmada People's Progress Struggle March), marching over 100 kilometers. Marchers accompanied a seven-member team, including Medha Patkar, who all decided to give up their lives for the river. They were stopped on the Gujarat border. The government deployed Gujarati police and bussed thousands of government-supported pro-dam demonstrators from urban centers to counter-protest. The confrontation would last nearly two weeks. Marchers, who each had their hands voluntarily tied together to demonstrate their non-violence, were beaten, arrested, and dragged into trucks in which they were driven miles away and dumped in the wilderness. </p> <p>Finally on January 7, 1991, the seven-member team began an indefinite hunger strike. Two days earlier Baba Amte had himself committed to a sit-in unto death. As tension rose, Indian and international press, TV, and documentary crews increased their coverage. Environmental activists increased pressure on Washington. </p> <p>Shaken by the unfavorable news coverage, the World Bank announced it would institute an Independent Review of the Sardar Sarovar projects. The review was the first of its kind and included sweeping mandates and oversight procedures. It may have been the first time in the history of the World Bank that a people's movement influenced their policy decisions. </p> <p>On January 28, the fasters ended their hunger strike after 22 days without food. Medha Patkar, one of those fasting, was near death. The short-term victory was bittersweet: many were distrustful of the World Bank, but they returned home with the other protesters. </p> <p>After some claimed the end of the hunger strike to be a victory for the Indian government, NBA protesters claimed they would stay in villages until drowning from the Sardar Sarovar reservoir. In response, the government banned Patkar and other activists from the villages during the monsoon, and prohibited the villagers from holding anti-dam protests. The NBA defied the bans, and hundreds of their supporters were arrested during the monsoon months. Known as 'monsoon satyagrahas,' hundreds of individuals refused to move as rising waters entered fields and homes. In most of the monsoon satyagrahas, police physically dragged people out of flooding areas in an attempt to rob the protest of its symbolic power. Arrests, beatings, and detentions rose in Madhya Pradesh, where many declared readiness for monsoon satyagraha between 1992 and 1993.</p> <p>International human rights NGOs began documenting abuses against NBA activists. A June 1992 report by Human Rights Watch noted increases in arbitrary arrests, illegal detentions, beatings, rape and other forms of physical abuses. Some reports document Indian police shooting and killing individuals during forced relocation. Other NGOs worked to form the Narmada International Human Rights Panel, which garnered support of 42 environmental and human rights NGOs representing 16 countries. </p> <p>The Bank's Independent Review, known as the Morse Commission, issued its report in June 1992. The report exposed the Bank's violation of its own policies and recommended drastic reform of the relocation programs and environmental assessment. It warned that opposition to the dam was so strong in the affected villages that the authorities would have to use "unacceptable means" to get the dam built. However, the Bank reassured the Indian government it would continue support, but only if the government met benchmarks for reform. </p> <p>In response to the Morse Commission's report, environmental activists wrote an open letter to World Bank President Lewis Preston, which they published as a full-page advertisement in the London Financial Times. It warned that if the Bank refused to withdraw funding for Sardar Sarovar then NGOs would launch a campaign to cut government funding of the Bank. The letter was endorsed by 250 NGOs and coalitions from 37 countries. Similar actions were taken in the Washington Post and the New York Times.</p> <p>A February 1993 "Peoples' Referendum" in the Narmada Valley, carried out by the NBA, organized over 22,500 families in opposition to forced relocation. </p> <p>With mounting pressure from NBA, other citizen activists, and international NGOs and Economic Funds, the Indian government soon canceled the remaining loans knowing that it could not meet the Bank's guidelines, thus ending support from the World Bank for the Sardar Sarovar dam. The controversy led to the creation of the World Bank Inspection Panel in 1993. “It was a milestone for the human rights movement and the first mechanism established to enable local groups to challenge World Bank projects” (Narula).</p> <p>While the withdrawal of the World Bank was a milestone accomplishment for NBA and social movements across the globe, it was unfortunately not the end of the Narmada dam struggle. Even without the World Bank's support, the Indian government pledged to continue the dam project with its own funds. The Bank's withdrawal in 1993 affected dam construction much less than anticipated. Further, the withdrawal reduced the Indian government's accountability to the outside world. The campaign against the dam refocused their effort on the Supreme Court of India. One criticism of NBA's strategy is that it avoided the Supreme Court until the withdrawal of the World Bank left them no choice. </p> <p>Construction continues to this day (March 2010). The Sardar Sarovar dam has already displaced well over 320,000 people, with over a million affected by related canal systems and other projects. NBA continues direct action and legal processes with international involvement to stop further dam construction on the Narmada. </p> </div><fieldset class="fieldgroup group-addnotes collapsible"><legend>Research Notes</legend><div class="field field-type-text field-field-influenes"> <div class="field-label">Influences:&nbsp;</div> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> Gandhi&#039;s campaign for Indian independence influenced this campaign (1) </div> </div> </div> <div class="field field-type-text field-field-sources"> <div class="field-label">Sources:&nbsp;</div> <div class="field-items"> <div class="field-item odd"> &quot;THE HOLIEST RIVER .&quot; Friends of River Narmada.
