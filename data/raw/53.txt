</li><li><strong>India Against Corruption</strong> does not permit any usage of its name(s) and title(s) in connection with the 2010-2013 LokPal Bill agitations.

IAC protested the proposed use of UID/AADHAR to faciliate the entry of unregulated foreign telecom operators into the Indian banking space to create excessive money supply and indulge in hawala.

<strong>FRAUD: Or how the citizens were deceived by Anna, Ramdev, Kiran Bedi &amp;Co.</strong><br />
</p>
<p class='vspace'>On 14 Nov. 2010, at a public meeting it was announced an "FIR" had been lodged in Parliament Street Police station <strong>on behalf of "India Against Corruption"</strong> against the CWG scams. Actually there was no such FIR because the police station said it didn't come exclusively inside their jurisdiction and was under a Special Law (ie. Prevention of Corruption Act). The SHO did, however, acknowledge receiving a copy and directed the informants to the Magistrate in terms of section 155 CrPC. (<em>That is what they are holding in the picture above</em>).
</p>
<p class='vspace'>A retd. Chief Justice (Justice D.S.Tewatia) then suggested another complaint (in 375 pages) be compiled and delivered to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (SP-CBI) that very day. This was quickly put together and was very badly xeroxed by Arvind to make it unreadable.(A copy is available in IAC's private archives). The shoddy complaint was dismissed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Amit Bansal on 26 Nov.2011 who also directed in another matter that a FIR be registered against Kiran Bedi for duping various police organizations <a class='urllink' href='http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/kiran-bedi-being-targeted-kejriwal/article2672866.ece' rel='nofollow'>[13]</a>.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Except for the first 2 complaints on CWG like "Queens Baton Relay" and hotel rates (which was sourced from newspaper clippings) the rest of this complaint was all <em>padding</em> about substandard concrete used (along with Test certificates from the Test House in Ghaziabad) to construct drains and EWS housing Rohini in 2008-09 and was taken from an old CAG report, and also some purchase of substandard medical equipment which activist Subhash Chandra Agrawal (<em>seen next to Anna in pic</em>) had got about 100 pages of RTI data in 2009. In all it may have added up to about 20-30 crores of actual wrongdoing at the very most.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>IAC which was then holding over 7,000 pages of hard evidence, had refused to share any information with these PCRF deceivers due to mounting mistrust over the direction the <em>andolan</em> was taking to let the offenders get away scot free with the loot by fooling the public using paid media (no wonder <em>Agnivesh</em> is smiling so broadly).

<p><br />That same evening a public rally was organised by Baba Ramdev's 'Bharat Swabhiman Trust' titled as <em>Bhrastachar ke Khilaf JanYudh</em> ("People's War Against Corruption") attended by Anna Hazare and some Muslim clerics like Maulana Syed Kalbe, whom Ramdev was promoting after the Deobandis had distanced from Ramdev. Arvind Kejriwal spoke for about 30 minutes on various national scams but hardly touched on CWG scam or the irrefutable scam evidence available to the <em>andolan</em>. IAC felt betrayed &amp; deceived, but expressed its fury privately that the usage of its name and banners could not now be tolerated for attempts to dilute the focus of the protest and divert the public anger into <em>cul-de-sacs</em> like LokPal Bill.

<p>On 17 Nov. 2010, the PCRF <strong>unilaterally</strong> registers the domain name of "www.indiaagainstcorruption.org" to call a press conference (arranged and paid for by <strong>Bharat Swabhiman Trust</strong> of controversial medicine man Baba Ramdev) on 01 Dec. 2010 at "National Sports Club of India" (New Delhi). 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>At the meeting on 01 Dec. 2010, which was again held only under title of <em>Bhrastachar ke Khilaf JanYudh</em> when asked about status of the criminal Writ Petition to be filed by "India Against Corruption" for non-registration of a FIR by Delhi Police on 14.10.2010, Kiran Bedi feigned ignorance of it and mentioned that the LokPal Bill agitation of Anna Hazare is now being conducted under the IAC banner (which had actually never been previously discussed nor agreed with HRA). Anna Hazare then also announced to the media that "India Against Corruption" is the name for his LokPal andolan, and circulated a copy of,

</li><li>At no stage did any person connected with PCRF have any authority to use name of IAC for anything other than CWG-2010 agitation, (this resulted from temporary breakdown in communications as HRA is a private body with its own agenda).

<p class='vspace'>9 April 2011: At the core of what is presented as a Jantar Mantar rainbow coalition against corruption is, in fact, a carefully orchestrated campaign that was rebuffed last year and has now struck back with a vengeance — deploying a fasting Anna Hazare to armtwist the Centre into an unprecedented agreement. The key faces of the Jantar Mantar protest, Anna Hazare, Aamir Khan, Baba Ramdev and Arvind Kejriwal, had combined when they wrote to the Centre calling for ex-IPS officer Kiran Bedi to be "made" Chief Information Commissioner in the wake of Wajahat Habibullah's retirement. The Centre roundly rebuffed them and appointed A.N.Tiwari as CIC instead <a class='urllink' href='http://www.indianexpress.com/news/jantar-mantar-core-group-lost-out-last-yr-struck-back-with-anna/773844/0' rel='nofollow'>[16]</a>, <a class='urllink' href='https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=171265002899282' rel='nofollow'>[17]</a>.

</p>
<p class='vspace'>These brokers originally intended the fake IAC movement as a tool to remove the BJP's reigning gang of 4 (Venkiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Ananth Kumar) to promote crony capitalism for select corporate groups like Reliance, Tatas, Adani, Essar etc. by the device of getting Narendra Modi, Rajnath Singh &amp;Co. installed at the helm of the BJP.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Instances of such crony capitalism once the BJP comes to power at the centre include the takeover of the asset stripped BSNL and MTNL by Reliance so that Mukesh Ambani can launch the 4G services without paying the exchequer for spectrum. Similarly the sale of asset stripped national carrier "Air India" to either Reliance or Tatas like BJP did in the Centaur Hotel scam. <a class='urllink' href='http://www.hindu.com/2005/07/28/stories/2005072817190100.htm' rel='nofollow'>[18]</a>, <a class='urllink' href='http://www.rediff.com/money/2002/nov/19centau.htm' rel='nofollow'>[19]</a>.

<p class='vspace'>Once it started becoming apparent in early 2012 that HRA and not dance to their tune and would be taking over the fake IAC campaign to shut it down, these brokers (who project themselves as patriots in public) started another fake body <strong>Action Committee Against Corruption in India</strong> (ACACI) on 2 Apr. 2012 along with the 3rd leg of their syndicate Baba Ramdev.

</p>
<p class='vspace'>Ramdev is a self-styled "baba" (with pretensions to being a "Swami") who cloaks himself in the sacred "bhagwa" (saffron) to pass freely among the credulous in India. Ramdev was under numerous Income Tax scrutiny cases causing him to approach Arvind Kejriwal (then an Income Tax officer on long leave and also an RSS boy) for "consultancy". The pair then concocted the audacious scheme of a fake IAC movement to cloak Ramdev in fake respectability as an anti-corruption crusader and buy him time. Using Ramdev's funds and supported by a bevy of Ford Foundation financed NGOs, the pair roped in RSS activists and paid them heavily <a class='urllink' href='http://thediplomat.com/2011/08/anna-hazare-going-too-far/' rel='nofollow'>[22]</a> to fake a popular protest movement.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>In March 2011 the RSS's core committee the <em>Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha</em> meeting at Puttur (Karnataka) gave its tacit support to Ramdev's andolan. On 02 Apr. 2011, the RSS announced the formation of an anti-corruption front, with Baba Ramdev as its patron and K.N. Govindacharaya as its convener. On 8 April 2011 a <a class='urllink' href='http://www.indiaagainstcorruption.org.in/uploads/Main/RSS_Anna_letter.jpg' rel='nofollow'><strong>letter from Suresh ("Bhaiyya") Joshi pledging RSS support to Anna</strong></a> was publicly delivered to Anna at his fast venue by Ram Madhav and Ors.

A week later RSS's Suresh Joshi directed every swayamsevak to render all possible cooperation to Shri Baba Ramdev.

</p>
<p class='vspace'>After Ramdev cut a deal with the Congress Party to save his assets, he began actively working against passing of the Lokpal Bill. On 12 May 2012 he mischievously incited Muslim community at a meeting called by Iliyas Azmi (former MP from Farrukhabad) to link the passage of Lokpal Bill with their demand for reservations under Article 341 of the Constitution <a class='urllink' href='http://twocircles.net/2012may12/dalit_muslim_leaders_urge_baba_ramdev_lead_their_fight.html' rel='nofollow'>[25]</a>.

<p class='vspace'>A few months later on 10 Oct. 2012 Kejriwal launched an attack on Law Minister Salman Khurshid the sitting Congress MP from Farrukhabad <a class='urllink' href='http://in.news.yahoo.com/tv-sting-kejriwal-now-demands-salman-khurshids-resignation-112515545.html' rel='nofollow'>[26]</a>.

<hr />
<p class='vspace'><strong><em>At IAC's Core Committee meeting on 03.09.20103 the following <a class='urllink' href='https://we.riseup.net/assets/154402/IAC%20MoM%202013%20final.pdf' rel='nofollow'><strong>agreed statement</strong></a> was issued concerning the deamalgamation of persons under IAC's banner  inclined to fight corruption using political processes.</em></strong>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>a) It was publicly announced on 02 August 2012 evening by Sh. Arvind Kejriwal and his friends who were on an “indefinite fast” under the banner of “India Against Corruption” that the national anti-corruption movement would take a political
nature/turn including by forming a political party and contesting elections.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>b) This unilateral announcement by Arvind Kejriwal met with considerable internal opposition within IAC movement (which is ideologically against direct participation in politics). Arvind’s announcement was viewed by IAC as a device to distract from the popular dissatisfaction with demand for Lokpal Bill after overuse of methods
like <em>satyagraha</em> and repeated fasting (<em>anshan</em>) caused IAC to lose public support across India.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>c) In the surcharged atmosphere, a series of public disagreements between the “political” and “apolitical” groups of IAC were being reported in the media affecting the IAC’s reputation. The IAC’s social networking sites and mailing lists were also hacked, manipulated and misused to wrongly project that the public mood wanted IAC to go political. IAC members and the public at large were being subjected to a barrage of propaganda and were tremendously confused by the “split”.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>d) IAC HQ decided that the movement shall remain apolitical, and “Team Arvind” would exit by/on 2 October 2012 after announcing the name of their party which would be different from India Against Corruption’s. The cyber war, however, still continued.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>e) It was in these circumstances that social activist Er. Sarbajit Roy was inducted by IAC’s HQ on 17 Oct 2012 to resolve the cyber warring and settle the issue of who would retain / use the India Against Corruption brand, which was entrusted to him <em>pende lis</em>, while the funds collection issues were being simultaneously resolved.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>f) On 26th October 2012 it was mutually conveyed/agreed to IAC HQ that Arvind and his
faction would completely exit from IAC, give up their claims to the IAC name and form their political party with a substantially different name by 26th November 2012. It was also agreed that announcements and campaigns made in the period
between 26.10.2012 and 25.11.2012 would not bind / devolve on the other.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>g) It was agreed in principle that the funds collected by Team Arvind till 25th Nov.2012 and with them could be held by them and Team Arvind would be responsible for rendering / settling the accounts to whoever required it.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>h) From 26th Oct 2012 onwards Er. Sarbajit Roy is nominated as “National Convenor” by IAC HQ to be the public face of the IAC movement. Er. Roy in turn is selecting and nominating the eminent citizens and RTI activists of India known for their
integrity and competence to be the IAC’s core committee members on a voluntary basis.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>i) Team Arvind have generally complied with their assurances and on 24.Nov.2012 have floated their organization under name and style of “Aam Aadmi Party” w.e.f 26.Nov.2012 and their erstwhile IAC India Against Corruption website <a class='urllink' href='http://www.indiaagainstcorruption.org' rel='nofollow'><strong>www.indiaagainstcorruption.org</strong></a> was duly
disabled by them.

<p class='vspace'>On 10 Nov. 2012, <a class='urllink' href='http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/anna-hazare-claims-iacs-name-arvind-kejriwal-says-will-oblige/1/228636.html' rel='nofollow'><strong>Kiran Bedi brought Anna Hazare to Delhi to lay claim to the India Against Corruption brand name</strong></a>. It was mischievously reported in paid online media that Arvind Kejriwal "who had left the movement 2 months back had agreed to give the IAC name to his 'guru'". At the morning conference Anna posed as founder of IAC and told reporters "The movement of India Against Corruption was launched by me to fight corruption". <a class='urllink' href='http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/team-anna-meeting-over-medha-parkar-addresses-media/1/228609.html' rel='nofollow'>"On the issue of using the name IAC, Hazare said <strong>if Kejriwal-led group gives it</strong>, he will take it."</a>. Hazare also said his photos used to be earlier on IAC's banners. On 11 Nov. 2012, the Indian Express published a report <a class='urllink' href='http://www.indianexpress.com/news/anna-s-new-team-wants-an-old-name-says-we-are-india-against-corruption/1029940/0' rel='nofollow'><strong>Anna’s new team wants an old name, says we are India Against Corruption</strong></a>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Concerned by these news reports, a furious HRA reminded Kejriwal of his assurances, and on 11 Nov. 2011, the following "<strong>Half-baked</strong>" and "<strong>self serving</strong>" press release issued on behalf of Team Arvind from their official email ID <strong>&lt;ash.ashwati2012@gmail.com&gt;</strong> <a class='urllink' href='http://rti4citizens.blogspot.in/2012/11/re-hum-iac-media-urgent-iac-press_5394.html' rel='nofollow'>[31]</a>

<p  style='text-align: center;'> <strong>PRESS RELEASE / 11.November.2012</strong><br /> on behalf of<br /> <strong>The India Against Corruption</strong> (Kejriwal) national anti-corruption movement<br />
</p><hr />
<p><strong>India Against Corruption</strong> has noted reports being published and circulated in various newspapers and media channels stating that Shri Arvind Kejriwal has agreed that the name "<strong>India Against Corruption</strong>" will be exclusively used by Shri Anna Hazare ji and funds will be collected in name of "<strong>India Against Corruption</strong>" in a bank account to be opened by Smt. Kiran Bedi &amp; Ors. It has also been imputed therein that Shri Arvind Kejriwal would have no objection to Anna Hazare ji exclusively using the India Against Corruption name, banner etc. if he was asked to relinquish his rights, claims and titles in the India Against Corruption and IAC brand names in favour of Shri Anna Hazare ji.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>It is clarified as follows:
</p>
<p class='vspace'>1) The brand names "India Against Corruption" and "IAC"  and all exclusive titles and rights therein neither vests with Shri Arvind Kejriwal nor with Shri Anna Hazare ji  or with any other definitely settled person or organisation.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>2)  India Against Corruption states that all graphics, logos, and brand names of the India Against Corruption movement were placed in the public domain and free of copyright a long time ago by their authors and creators. In view of this ground reality it is very well known to all concerned parties that there was never any copyrighted trademark or logo for India Against Corruption as the same could not be done.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>3) No money has been collected till now only in the name of India Against Corruption and certainly no duly accounted for receipts have been issued in the name of India Against Corruption. For anyone to say that somebody like Shri Arvind Kejriwal would relinquish the rights and accounts in IAC to anybody else would necessarily imply that funds meant for the IAC have been exclusively collected by him until now. This is not the case. It is also very well settled in law that a person can only relinquish or transfer his definite title and defined shares.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>4) Shri Anna Hazare ji was not associated with the IAC movement initially, He associated himself later on. Smt Kiran Bedi and Ms. Sunita Godara were also initial volunteers of the IAC movement, but ranked pari-passu with Shanti Bhusha ji, Shri  Prasant Bhushan, Shri Arvind Kejriwal &amp; many other selfless IAC volunteers. As such the claim that Shri Arvind Kejriwal left the IAC movement 2 months back to form a political party is false, mischievous and without any foundation. Shri Kejriwal may issue his own personal statement concerning this.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>5) India Against Corruption was never an hierarchial organisation. That would be undemocratic and against everything IAC stands for.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>6) Shri Anna Hazare ji under the cover of people's protests organised under the banner of India Against Corruption and financed by duly accounts funds of the PCRF and other social organisations has earned crores of rupees from sale of branded merchandise like shirts, caps and other articles with slogans like "I am Anna" by his volunteers. The IAC has not received even 1 rupee from such sales which had nothing to do with IAC. The Indian public hopes that accounts for such huge revenues would be rendered to them by the people who expect to collect and manage IAC's funds in the future.

<p class='vspace'>Hello Gen VK<br />
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Since last 3 months Anna has done nothing for IAC and has not contacted IAC coordinators. All he doing is creating confusion in mind of public. Dos he have any action plan, if so what it is ? Now there is no need or hope for Lokpal Bill. That phase of IAC movement is over and nobody wants Lokpal Bill not even NCPRI.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>We had also collected over Rs. 28 lakhs which was given to IAC for Anna through Kiran Bedi. Team Arvind is not replying to us how the money was used, they say we should contact Anna Hazare, Kiran Bedi or anyone else we care in IAC as they were collecting funds for PCRF not for IAC If you have any idea about our money, please inform us or return the same to us immediately with interest.

<p>Sir,
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I am also given to understand that yesterday you led a candle-light march in Patna where you announced that IAC as a party of 'aam aadmis' is entering politics and would be recommending "clean" candidates. I am very surprised that you could make such a preposterous statement.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Accordingly, in view of your self evidently poor track record of identifying "clean" persons and your non-existent record of success in fighting corruption, I would sincerely request you, as your junior (in age) to reflect on the damage being caused to the ancient and honorable institution of the Indian Army by your "antics" and to the Indian nation (which is exposed to the threat of a "manufactured" mini-war to save the corrupt political classes on both sides of the border) by your inappropriate utterances.

</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div class='frame lrindent' > 
<p class='vspace'>Lot of confusion being created about IAC only by Kiran Bedi because we're asking her about where all the money collected from IAC West Bengal totaling more then 28 lakh disappeared.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Everyday she was changing her story  not coming on phone.  A group of us come to Delhi and go to her house and basement office in Udday Park. For 3 days she don't meet us and young girls in her office tell us lies. We find that she is using the money into Anna's new office which while rented by Vicky Donor producer was 5 lakh rupee per month. The landlord is Congress worker and very close to Bedi. Then we ask where the rent money is coming from, they tell some "anonymous" donor has given 12 lacs for paying the rent of 1 lac per month.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>There is no anonymous donation, it is stolen money of poor people of Bengal and Kiran Bedi, Anna and VeekY are only Congress persons and stealing our money. Howe many other states she has done same cheating will come out in police investigation.

</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div class='frame lrindent' > 
<p class='vspace'>Having fought a bitter battle with Arvind Kejriwal for the India Against Corruption name, the new Team Anna will not work under that banner any more. Anna Hazare's NGO in Ralegan Siddhi, Bhrashtachar Virodhi Jan Andolan Nyas, will henceforth be the platform from which he and his team will hold programmes. The office at Sarvodaya Enclave here, which had been the bone of contention between volunteers and core team, will wind up by the end of this month. The Ralegan Siddhi office, opened on January 12, will be the centre of the movement. A call will be taken at a later date on a Delhi branch office, if required.

<div class='vspace'></div><h3><a name='tocanchor22' id='tocanchor22'></a>9 Statement of National Convenor on Jan Tantra Morcha</h3>

<p><strong><em>The following <a class='urllink' href='http://humjanege.blogspot.in/2013/01/re-iacrg-sainik-samaj-partys-viewpoint.html' rel='nofollow'><strong>public statement was issued on 16.01.2013 by IAC</strong></a> in reply to a request to support Gen (Retd.) V.K.Singh under banner of Jan Tantra Morcha after "Anna Hazare had left the IAC".</em></strong>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>IAC had previously been outraged at juxtaposition of images of HRA's martyrs/<em>shaheeds</em> Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev etc, with those of Vivekananda and Gandhi at public performances by Anna Hazare's troupe with obscene dances, public disrespect to national flag and consumption of alcohol as at a function held at Nashik on 24.May.2012 to raise money for Anna.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div  style='text-align: center;'><img src='http://www.indiaagainstcorruption.org.in/uploads/Main/bvjatamasha.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br /></div>
<p><br />Pertaining to your remarks on Anna Hazare leaving IAC, Mr Anna Hazare was never a part of the IAC. He is a duffer and character actor who was massively overpaid for his walk on appearances. Like every cheap character actor he is never seen after sun-down ;-). In fact an inverse Keshto Mukherjee.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>What was Anna Hazare before Team Arvind elevated him to National status in 2011 ? In rural Maharashtra his travelling circus is well known for its set routine for which they are paid between 50,000 and 1 lakh for their night shows.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><strong>Act 1:</strong>  Some Comedian and poetry reading with cheap dialogues. Public starts getting in the mood and slowly opening their bottles.<br />
<strong>Act-2:</strong> <em>Tamasha / Lavani</em> troupe with all <em>Jhatak Mataks</em> (see attached picture) . This carries on for 1 hour. Public is nicely sozzled by now and dancing in front of stage (and also on stage).<br />
20 minute interval to cool crowd down.<br />
<strong>Act-3:</strong> Some local politician / sponsor comes on stage and makes introductory remarks about Desh Bhakti / Bhagat Singh etc. and appeals to noble nature of crowd and imagery of Bharat Mata and brings on ANNA.<br />
<strong>Act-4:</strong> <strong>ANNA THE GREAT</strong> makes his standard 20 minute speech including on evils of alcohol. This is the signal for the  public to start weaving their way out from the venue.<br />
</p>
<p class='vspace'>All the while the venue is disrespectfully festooned with the Indian Flag at night.<br />And you want us to support such people whom your General associates with ?<br />

</p>
<p class='vspace'>Dear Friends
</p>
<p class='vspace'>For the last 3 months Dr. Kiran Bedi has been running a smear campaign to persuade respected Anna Hazareji to "claim" / "reclaim" the India Against Corruption banner / brand-name  etc - call it what you will.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>We have also seen an explosion of venom on this list from all sides - which we have tried to circulate even though some of it was very abusive and even made absolutely false personal allegations against me.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I am glad to announce that due to efforts of our well-wishers (after all we are all together in this epochal movement against corruption, and we greatly respect IESMs etc) Shri Anna Hazareji has announced that he is dropping his claim to the IAC brand name etc and will close his Delhi office.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><a class='urllink' href='http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Anna-drops-IAC-brand-name--to-close-Delhi-office/1061067/' rel='nofollow'>Anna drops claim to IAC name</a>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>IAC therefore salutes respected Anna Hazareji, we will always love, respect and cherish his pioneering work against corruption, and shall follow as closely as we can in his footsteps and uphold his ideas and principles.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>We respect Anna's view that the BJVA will be a grassroots movement of the people of BHARAT. We at IAC, however, shall convey forcefully the ideology of the people of INDIA. Both India and Bharat are 2 birds sitting on the same tree - always together and needing to co-exist. We view our Armed Forces and the IESM movement as the natural link between India and Bharat, and are confident that together we shall forge this nation into a pure and righteous nation such as History has never seen before.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>We fully support Annaji's meeting at Patna, and even though Annaji may not now have a home or office in Delhi due to the financial crises, he is always in our hearts and ever welcome at my own humble abode or those of IAC's officer bearers.
