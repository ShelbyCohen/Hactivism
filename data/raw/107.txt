        was developed as a lecture given at several universities and colleges 
        in the midwest in 1970, and finalized as a paper for the December 1970 
        annual meeting of the American Historical Association in Boston. It was 
        issued as a pamphlet in 1971, and first published in<u> Recent Sociology 
        No. 4: Family, Marriage, and the Struggle of the Sexes</u> ed. by Hans 
        Peter Dreitzel, New York: The Macmillan Co., 1972, pp. 201-216. It was 
        reprinted several times.<br>

        in the nineteen twenties, feminism died in the United States. It was a 
        premature death. Feminists had only recently obtained their long sought 
        for tool, the vote, with which they had hoped to make an equal place for 
        women in this society. But it seemed like a final one. By the time the 
        granddaughters of the women who had sacrificed so much for suffrage had 
        grown to maturity, not only had social mythology firmly ensconced women 
        in the home, but the very term &quot;feminist&quot; had become an epithet.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">Social 
        fact, however, did not always coincide with social mythology. During the 
        era of the &quot;feminine mystique&quot; when the percentage of degrees 
        given to wmen was dropping, their absolute numbers were rising astronomically. 
        Their participation in the labor force was also increasing even while 
        their position within it was declining. Opportunities to work, the trend 
        toward smaller families, plus changes in status symbols from a leisured 
        wife at home to a second car and TV, all contributed to a basic alteration 
        of the female labor force from one of primarily single women under 25 
        to one of married women and mothers over 40. Added to these developments 
        was an increased segregation of the job market, a flooding of traditional 
        female jobs (e.g. teaching and social work) by men, a decrease of women 
        'e percentage of the professional and technical jobs by a third and a 
        commensurate decline in their relative income. The result was the creation 
        of a class of highly educated, underemployed women.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">In 
        the early sixties feminism was still an unmentionable, but its ghost was 
        slowly awakening from the dead. The first sign of new life came with the 
        establishment of the Commission on the Status of Women by President Kennedy 
        in 1961. Created at the urging of Esther Peterson of the Women's Bureau, 
        in its short life the Commission came out with several often radical reports 
        thoroughly documenting women's second class status. It was followed by 
        the formation of a citizen's advisory council and fifty state commissions.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">Many 
        of the people involved in these commissions became the nucleus of women 
        who, dissatisfied with the lack of progress made on commission recommendations, 
        joined with Betty Friedan in 1966 to found the National Organization for 
        Women.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">NOW 
        was the first new feminist organization in almost fifty years, but it 
        was not the sole beginning of the organized expression of the movement. 
        The movement actually has two origins, from two different strata of society, 
        with two different styles, orientations, values, and forms of organization. 
        In many ways there were two separate movements which only in the last 
        year have merged sufficiently for the rubric &quot;women's liberation&quot; 
        to be truly an umbrella term for the multiplicity of organizations and 
        groups.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
        first of these I call the older branch of the movement, partially because 
        it began first, and partially because the median age of its activists 
        is higher. In addition to NOW it contains such organizations as the PWC 
        (Professional Women's Caucus), FEW (Federally Employed Women) and the 
        self-defined &quot;right wing&quot; of the movement, WEAL (Women's Equity 
        Action League).<br>

      participants of both branches tend to be predominantly white, middle-class 
      and college educated, but the composition of the older is much more heterogeneous 
      than that of the younger. In issues, however, this trend is reversed with 
      those of the younger being more diverse. While the written programs and 
      aims of the older branch span a wide spectrum, their activities tend to 
      be concentrated on the legal and economic difficulties women face. These 
      groups are primarily made up of women who work and are substantially concerned 
      with the problems of working women. Their style of organization has tended 
      to be formal with numerous elected officers, boards of directors, bylaws 
      and the other trappings of democratic procedure. All started as top down 
      organizations lacking in a mass base. Some have subsequently developed a 
      mass base, some have not yet done so, and others don't want to.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">In 
      1967 and 1968, unaware of and unknown to NOW or the state commissions, the 
      other branch of the movement was taking shape. Contrary to popular myth 
      it did not begin on the campus; nor was it started by SDS. However, its 
      activators were, to be trite, on the other side of the generation gap. While 
      few were students, all were &quot;under 30&quot; and had received their 
      political education as participants or concerned observers of the social 
      action projects of the last decade. Many came direct from New Left and civil 
      rights organizations where they had been shunted into traditional roles 
      and faced with the self-evident contraction of working in a &quot;freedom 
      movement&quot; but not being very free. Others had attended various courses 
      on women in the multitude of free universities springing up around the country 
      during those years.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">At 
      least five groups in five different cities (Chicago, Toronto, Detroit, Seattle 
      and Gainesville, Fla.) formed spontaneously, independently of each other. 
      They came at a very auspicious moment. 1967 was the year in which the blacks 
      kicked the whites out of the civil rights movement, student power had been 
      discredited by SDS and the New Left was on the wane. Only draft resistance 
      activities were on the increase, and this movement more than any other exemplified 
      the social inequities of the sexes. Men could resist the draft. Women could 
      only council resistance.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">There 
      had been individual temporary caucuses and conferences of women as early 
      as 1964 when Stokely Carmichael made his infamous remark that &quot;the 
      only position for women in SNCC is prone.&quot; But it was not until 1967 
      that the groups developed a determined, if cautious, continuity and began 
      to consciously expand themselves. In 1968 they held their first, and so 
      far only, national conference attended by over 200 women from around this 
      country and Canada on less than a month's notice. They have been expanding 
      exponentially ever since.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">This 
      expansion has been more amebic than organized because the younger branch 
      of the movement prides itself on its lack of organization. Eschewing structure 
      and damning the idea of leadership, it has carried the concept of &quot;everyone 
      doing their own thing&quot; almost to its logical extreme. Thousands of 
      sister chapters around the country are virtually independent of each other, 
      linked only by the numerous journals, newsletters and cross country travelers. 
      Some cities have a coordinating committee which attempts to maintain communication 
      between the local groups and channel newcomers into appropriate ones but 
      none have any power over group activities, let alone group ideas. One result 
      of this style is a very broad based, creative movement, which individuals 
      can relate to pretty much as they desire with no concern for orthodoxy or 
      doctrine. Another result is a kind of political impotency. It is virtually 
      impossible to coordinate a national action, assuming there could be any 
      agreement on issues around which to coordinate one. Fortunately, the older 
      branch of the movement does have the structure necessary to coordinate such 
      actions, and is usually the one to initiate them as NOW did for the August 
      26 national strike last year.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">It 
      is a common mistake to try to place the various feminist organizations on 
      the traditional left/right spectrum. The terms &quot;reformist&quot; and 
      &quot;radical&quot; are convenient and fit into our preconceived notions 
      about the nature of political organization, but they tell us nothing of 
      relevance. As with most everything else, feminism cuts through the normal 
      categories and demands new perspectives in order to be understood. Some 
      groups often called &quot;reformist&quot; have a platform which would so 
      completely change our society it would be unrecognizable. Other groups called 
      &quot;radical&quot; concentrate on the traditional female concerns of love, 
      sex, children and interpersonal relationships (although with untraditional 
      views). The activities of the organizations are similarly incongruous. The 
      most typical division of labor, ironically, is that those groups labeled 
      &quot;radical&quot; engage primarily in educational work while the so-called 
      &quot;reformist&quot; ones are the activists. It is structure and style 
      rather than ideology which more accurately differentiates the various groups 
      and even here there has been much borrowing on both sides. The older branch 
      has used the traditional forms of political action often with great skill, 
      while the younger branch has been experimental.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
      most prevalent innovation developed by the younger branch has been the &quot;rap 
      group.&quot; Essentially an educational technique, it has spread far beyond 
      its origins and become a mayor organizational unit of the whole movement, 
      most frequently used by suburban housewives. From a sociological perspective 
      the rap group is probably the most valuable contribution so far by the women 
      's liberation movement to the tools for social change.<br>

      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
      rap group serves two main purposes. One is traditional; the other is unique. 
      The traditional role is the simple process of bringing women together in 
      a situation of structured interaction. It has long been known that people 
      can be kept down as long as they are kept divided from each other, relating 
      more to those in a superior social position than to those in a position 
      similar to their own. It is when social development creates natural structures 
      in which people can interact with each other and compare their common concerns 
      that social movements take place. This is the function that the factory 
      served for the workers, the church for the Southern Civil Rights movement, 
      the campus for students and the ghetto for urban blacks.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">Women 
      have been largely deprived of a means of structured interaction and been 
      kept isolated in their individual homes relating more to men than to each 
      other. Natural structures are still largely lacking, though they have begun 
      to develop, but the rap group has created an artificial structure which 
      does much the same thing. This phenomenon was similar to the nineteenth 
      century development of a multitude of women's clubs and organizations around 
      every conceivable social and political purpose. These organizations taught 
      women political skills and eventually served as the primary communications 
      network for the spread of the suffrage movement. Yet after the great crusade 
      ended most of them vanished or became moribund. The rap groups are taking 
      their place and will serve much the same function for the future development 
      of this movement.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">They 
      do more than just bring women together as radical an activity as that may 
      be. The rap groups have become mechanisms for social change in and of themselves. 
      They are structures created specifically for the purpose of altering the 
      participants perceptions and conceptions of themselves and society at large. 
      The means by which this is done is called &quot;consciousness raising.&quot; 
      The process is very simple. Women come together in groups of five to fifteen 
      and talk to each other about their personal problems, personal experiences, 
      personal feelings and personal concerns. From this public sharing of experiences 
      comes the realization that what was thought to be individual is in fact 
      common; that what was thought to be a personal problem has a social cause 
      and probably a political solution. Women learn to see how social structures 
      and attitudes have molded them from birth and limited their opportunities. 
      They ascertain the extent to which women have been denigrated in this society 
      and how they have developed prejudices against themselves and other women.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">It 
      is this process of deeply personal attitude change that makes the rap group 
      such a powerful tool. The need of a movement to develop &quot;correct consciousness&quot; 
      has long been known. But usually this consciousness is not developed by 
      means intrinsic to the structure of the movement and does not require such 
      a profound resocialization of one's concept of self. This experience is 
      both irreversible and contagious. Once one has gone through such a &quot;resocialization&quot;, 
      one's view of oneself and the world is never the same again, whether or 
      not there is further active participation in the movement. Even those who 
      do &quot;drop out&quot; rarely do so without first spreading feminist ideas 
      among their own friends and colleagues. All who undergo &quot;consciousness 
      raising&quot; virtually compel themselves to seek out other women with whom 
      to share the experience, and thus begin new rap groups.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">There 
      are several personal results from this process. The initial one is a decrease 
      of self and group depreciation. Women come to see themselves as essentially 
      pretty groovy people. Along with this comes the explosion of the myth of 
      individual solution. If women are the way they are, because society has 
      made them that way, they can only change their lives significantly by changing 
      society. These feelings in turn create the consciousness of oneself as a 
      member of a group and the feeling of solidarity so necessary to any social 
      movement. From this comes the concept of sisterhood.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">This 
      need for group solidarity partially explains why men have been largely excluded 
      from the rap groups. It was not the initial reason, but it has been one 
      of the more beneficial byproducts. Originally, the idea was borrowed from 
      the Black Power movement, much in the public consciousness when the women's 
      liberation movement began. It was reinforced by the unremitting hostility 
      of most of the New Left men at the prospect of an independent women's movement 
      not tied to radical organizations. Even when this hostility was not present, 
      women in virtually every group in the U.S., Canada and Europe soon discovered 
      that the traditional sex roles reasserted themselves in the groups regardless 
      of the good intentions of the participants. Men inevitably dominated the 
      discussions, and usually would talk only about how women's liberation related 
      to men, or how men were oppressed by the sex roles. In segregated groups 
      women found the discussions to be more open, honest and extensive. They 
      could learn how to relate to other women and not just to men.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">Unlike 
      the male exclusion policy, the rap groups did not develop spontaneously 
      or without a struggle. The political background of many of the early feminists 
      of the younger branch predisposed them against the rap group as &quot;unpolitical&quot; 
      and they would condemn discussion meetings which &quot;degenerated&quot; 
      into &quot;bitch sessions.&quot; This trend was particularly strong in Chicago 
      and Washington, D. C. which had been centers of New Left activity. Meanwhile, 
      other feminists, usually with a civil rights or apolitical background, saw 
      that the &quot;bitch session&quot; obviously met a basic need. They seized 
      upon it and created the consciousness raising rap group. Developed initially 
      in New York and Gainesville, Fla., the idea soon spread throughout the country 
      becoming the paradigm for most movement organization.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">To 
      date, the major, though hardly exclusive, activity of the younger branch 
      has been organizing rap groups, putting on conferences, and putting out 
      educational literature, while that of the older branch has been using the 
      &quot;channels&quot; and other forms of political pressure to change specific 
      situations of inequity. In general, the younger branch has been organized 
      to attack attitudes and the older branch to attack structures.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">While 
      the rap groups have been excellent techniques for changing individual attitudes 
      they have not been very successful in dealing with social institutions. 
      Their loose informal structure encourages participation in discussion and 
      their supportive atmosphere elicits personal insight; but neither is very 
      efficient in handling specific tasks. Thus, while they have been of fundamental 
      value to the development of the movement it is the more structured groups 
      which are the more visibly effective.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">Individual 
      rap groups tend to flounder when their members have exhausted the virtues 
      of consciousness raising and decide they want to do something more concrete. 
      The problem is that most groups are unwilling to change their structure 
      when they change their tasks. They have accepted the ideology of &quot;structurelessness&quot; 
      without realizing the limitations of its uses. This is currently causing 
      an organizational crisis within the movement because the formation of rap 
      groups as a major movement function is becoming obsolete. Due to the intense 
      press publicity that began in the fall of 1969, as well as the numerous 
      &quot;overground&quot; books and articles now being circulated, women's 
      liberation has become practically a household word. Its issues are discussed 
      and informal rap groups formed by people who have-no explicit connection 
      with any movement group. Ironically, this subtle, silent and subversive 
      spread of feminist consciousness is causing a situation of political unemployment. 
      With educational work no longer such an overwhelming need women's liberation 
      groups have to develop new forms of organizations to deal with new tasks 
      in a new stage of development. This is necessitating a good deal of retrenchment 
      and rethinking. Cities undergoing this process often give the impression 
      of inactivity and only time will tell what will be the result.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">Initially 
      there was little ideology in the movement beyond a something feeling that 
      something was wrong. NOW was formed under the slogan &quot;full equality 
      for women in a truly equal partnership with men&quot; and specified eight 
      demands in a &quot;Bill of Rights.&quot; It and the other organizations 
      of the older branch have continued to focus around concrete issues feeling 
      that attempts at a comprehensive ideology have little to offer beyond internal 
      conflict.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">In 
      the younger branch a basic difference of opinion developed quite early. 
      It was disguised as a philosophical difference, was articulated and acted 
      on as a strategical one, but actually was more of a political disagreement 
      than anything else. The two sides involved were essentially the same people 
      who differed over the rap groups, but the split endured long after the groups 
      became ubiquitous. The original issue was whether the fledgling women's 
      liberation movement would remain a branch of the radical left movement, 
      or be an independent women's movement. Proponents became known as &quot;politicos&quot; 
      or &quot;feminists&quot; respectively and traded arguments about whether 
      &quot;capitalism was the enemy&quot;, or the male-dominated social institutions 
      and values. They also traded a few epithets with politicos calling feminists 
      politically unsophisticated and elitist, while in turn being accused of 
      subservience to the interests of left wing men.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">With 
      the influx of large numbers of previously apolitical women an independent, 
      autonomous women's liberation movement became a reality instead of an argument. 
      The spectrum shifted to the feminist direction, but the basic difference 
      in orientation still remained. Politicos now also call themselves feminists, 
      and many have left the left, but most see women's issues within a broader 
      political context while the original feminists continue to focus almost 
      exclusively on women's concerns. Although much of the bitterness of the 
      original dispute has subsided, politicos generated such distrust about their 
      motives that they prejudiced many women against all concerns of Left ideology. 
      This has led some feminists to the very narrow outlook that politicos most 
      feared they would adopt.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">Meanwhile, 
      faced with a female exodus, the radical left movement has forsaken the rhetoric 
      of its original opposition without relinquishing most of its sexist practices. 
      Embracing the position that women are a constituency to be organized, most 
      New Left (and some Old Left) organizations have created women's caucuses 
      to recruit women to &quot;more important activities.&quot; These are very 
      different from the women's caucuses of the professional associations that 
      have also mushroomed into existence. The latter are concerned with raising 
      feminist issues within their organizations. The New Left women's groups 
      serve much the same function as traditional ladies auxiliaries.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
      widely differing backgrounds and perspectives of the women in the movement 
      have resulted in as many different interpretations of women's status. Some 
      are more developed than others, and some are more publicized, yet as of 
      1971 there is no comprehensive set of beliefs which can accurately be labeled 
      women's liberationist, feminist, neofeminist or radical feminist ideology. 
      At best one can say there is general agreement on two theoretical concerns. 
      The first is the feminist critique of society, and the second is the idea 
      of oppression.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
      feminist critique starts from entirely different premises than the traditional 
      view and therefore neither can really refute the other. The latter assumes 
      that men and women are essentially different and should serve different 
      social functions. Their diverse roles and statuses simply reflect these 
      essential differences. The feminist perspective starts from the premise 
      that women and men are constitutionally equal and share the same human capabilities. 
      Observed differences therefore demand a critical analysis of the social 
      institutions which cause then.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
      concept of oppression brings into use a term which has long been avoided 
      out of a feeling that it was too rhetorical. But there was no convenient 
      euphemism and discrimination was inadequate to describe what happens to 
      women and what they have in common with other groups. As long as the word 
      remained illegitimate, so did the idea and it was too valuable not to use. 
      It is still largely an undeveloped concept in which the details have not 
      been sketched, but there appear to be two aspects to oppression which relate 
      much the same as two sides of a coin -- distinct, yet inseparable. The social 
      structural manifestations are easily visible as they are reflected in the 
      legal, economic, social and political institutions. The social psychological 
      ones are often intangible; hard to grasp and hard to alter. Group self-hate 
      and distortion of perceptions to justify a preconceived interpretation of 
      reality are just some of the factors being teased out.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">For 
      women, sexism describes the specificity of female oppression. Starting from 
      the traditional belief of the difference between the sexes, sexism embodies 
      two core concepts.<br>

    <td align="left" valign="top"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
      first is that men are more important than women. Not necessarily superior 
      -- we are far too sophisticated these days than to use those tainted terms 
      -- but more important, more significant, more valuable, more worthwhile. 
      This value justifies the idea that it is more important for a man, the &quot;breadwinner&quot;, 
      to have a job or a promotion, than a women, more important for a man to 
      be paid well, more important for a man to have an education and in general 
      to have preference over a women. It is the basis of the feeling by men that 
      if women enter a particular occupation they will degrade it and that men 
      must leave or be themselves degraded, and the feeling by women that they 
      can raise the prestige of their professions by recruiting men, which they 
      can only do by giving them the better jobs. From this value comes the attitude 
      that a husband must earn more than his wife or suffer a loss of personal 
      status and a wife must subsume her interests to his or be socially castigated. 
      From this value comes the practice of rewarding men for serving in the armed 
      forces and punishing women for having children. The first core concept of 
      sexist thought is that men do the important work in the world and the work 
      done by men is what is important.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
      second core concept is that women are here for the pleasure and assistance 
      of men. This is what is meant when women are told that their role is complementary 
      to that of men; that they should fulfill their natural &quot;feminine&quot; 
      functions; that they are &quot;different&quot; from men and should not compete 
      with them. From this concept comes the attitude that women are and should 
      be dependent on men; for everything but especially their identities, the 
      social definition of who they are. It defines the few roles for which women 
      are socially rewarded -- wife, mother and mistress -- all of which are pleasing 
      or beneficial to men, and leads directly to the &quot;pedestal&quot; theory 
      which extols women who stay in their place as good helpmates to men.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">It 
      is this attitude which stigmatizes those women who do not marry or who do 
      not devote their primary energies to the care of men and their children. 
      Association with a man is the basic criterion for participation by women 
      in this society and one who does not seek her identity through a man is 
      a threat to its social values. It is similarly this attitude which causes 
      women's liberation activists to be labeled as man haters for exposing the 
      nature of sexism. People feel that a woman not devoted to looking after 
      men must act this way because of hatred or inability to &quot;catch&quot; 
      one. The second core concept of sexist thought is that women's identities 
      are defined by their relationship to men and their social value by that 
      of the men they are related to.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
      sexism of our society is so pervasive that we are not even aware of all 
      its inequities. Unless one has developed a sensitivity to its workings, 
      by adopting a self-consciously contrary view, its activities are accepted 
      as &quot;normal&quot; and justified with little question. People are said 
      to &quot;choose&quot; what in fact they never thought about. a good example 
      is what happened during and after World War II. The sudden onslaught of 
      the war radically changed the whole structure of social relationships as 
      well as the economy. Men were drafted into the army and women into the labor 
      force. Now desperately needed, women's wants were provided for as were those 
      of the boys on the front. Federal financing of day care centers in the form 
      of the Landham Act passed Congress in a record two weeks. Special crash 
      training programs were provided for the new women workers to give them skills 
      they were not previously thought capable of exercising. Women instantly 
      assumed positions of authority and responsibility unavailable only the year 
      before.<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">But 
      what happened when the war ended? Both men and women had heeded their country's 
      call to duty to bring it to a successful conclusion. Yet men were rewarded 
      for their efforts and women punished for theirs. The returning soldiers 
      were given the G.I. Bill and other veterans benefits, as well as their jobs 
      back and a disproportionate share of the new ones created by the war economy. 
      Women, on the other hand, saw their child care centers dismantled and their 
      training programs cease. They were fired or demoted in droves and often 
      found it difficult to enter colleges flooded with those matriculating on 
      government money. Is it any wonder that they heard the message that their 
      place was in the home? Where else could they go?<br>
      <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
      eradication of sexism and the practices it supports, like those above, is 
      obviously one of the major goals of the women's liberation movement. But 
      it is not enough to destroy a set of values and leave a normative vacuum. 
      They have to be replaced with something. A movement can only begin by declaring 
      its opposition to the status quo. Eventually if it is to succeed, it has 
      to propose an alternative.<br>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">I 
        cannot pretend to be even partially definitive about the possible alternatives 
        contemplated by the numerous participants in the women's liberation movement. 
        Yet from the plethora of ideas and visions feminists have thought, discussed 
        and written about, I think there are two basic ideas emerging which express 
        the bulk of their concerns. I call these the Egalitarian Ethic and the 
        Liberation Ethic, but they are not independent of each other and together 
        they mesh into what can only be described as a feminist humanism.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
        Egalitarian Ethic means exactly what it says. The sexes are equal; therefore 
        sex roles must go. Our history has proven that institutionalized difference 
        inevitably means inequity and sex role stereotypes have long since become 
        anachronistic. Strongly differentiated sex roles were rooted in the ancient 
        division of labor; their basis has been torn apart by modern technology. 
        Their justification was rooted in the subjection of women to the reproductive 
        cycle. That has already been destroyed by modern pharmacology. The cramped 
        little categories of personality and social function to which we assign 
        people from birth must be broken open so that all people can develop independently, 
        as individuals. This means that there will be an integration of social 
        functions and life styles of men and women as groups until, ideally, one 
        cannot tell anything of relevance about a person's social role by knowing 
        their sex. But this increased similarity of the two groups also means 
        increased options for individuals and increased diversity in the human 
        race. No longer will there be men's work and women's work. No longer will 
        humanity suffer a schizophrenic personality desperately trying to reconcile 
        its &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; parts. No longer will 
        marriage be the institution where two half-people come together in hopes 
        of making a whole.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">The 
        Liberation Ethic says this is not enough. Not only must the limits of 
        the roles be changed, but their content as well. The Liberation Ethic 
        looks at the kinds of lives currently being led by men as well as women 
        and concludes that both are deplorable and neither are necessary. The 
        social institutions which oppress women as women, also oppress people 
        as people and can be altered to make a more humane existence for all. 
        So much of our society is hung upon the framework of sex role stereotypes 
        and their reciprocal functions that the dismantling of this structure 
        will provide the opportunity for making a more viable life for everyone.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">It 
        is important to stress that these two Ethics must work together in tandem. 
        If the first is emphasized over the second, then we have a women's rights 
        movement, not one of women's liberation. To seek only equality, given 
        the current male bias of the social values, is to assume that women want 
        to be like men or that men are worth emulating. It is to demand that women 
        be allowed to participate in society as we know it, to get their piece 
        of the pie, without questioning the extent to which that society is worth 
        participating in. This view is held by some, but most feminists today 
        find it inadequate. Those women who are more personally compatible in 
        what is considered the male role must realize that that role is made possible 
        only by the existence of the female sex role; in other words, only by 
        the subjection of women. Therefore women cannot become equal to men without 
        the destruction of those two interdependent mutually parasitic roles. 
        The failure to realize that the integration of the sex roles and the equality 
        of the sexes will inevitably lead to basic structural change is to fail 
        to seize the opportunity to decide the direction of those changes.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">It 
        is just as dangerous to fall into the trap of seeking liberation without 
        due concern for equality. This is the mistake made by many of the left 
        radicals. They find the general human condition to be wretched that they 
        feel everyone should devote their energies to the Millennial Revolution 
        in belief that the liberation of women will follow naturally the liberation 
        of people.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">However 
        women have yet to be defined as people, even among the radicals, and it 
        is erroneous to assume their interests are identical to those of men. 
        For women to subsume their concerns once again is to insure that the promise 
        of liberation will be a spurious one. There has yet to be created or conceived 
        by any political or social theorist a revolutionary society in which women 
        were equal to men and their needs duly considered. The sex role structure 
        has never been comprehensively challenged by any male philosopher and 
        the systems they have proposed have all presumed the existence of a sex-role 
        structure to some degree.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">Such 
        undue emphasis on the Liberation Ethic has also often led to a sort of 
        Radical Paradox. This is a situation the politicos frequently found themselves 
        in during the early days of the movement. They found repugnant the possibility 
        of pursuing &quot;reformist&quot; issues which might be achieved without 
        altering the basic nature of the system, and thus, they felt, only strengthen 
        the system. However, their search for a sufficiently radical action and/or 
        issue came to naught and they found themselves unable to do anything out 
        of fear that it might be counterrevolutionary. Inactive revolutionaries 
        are a good deal more innocuous than active &quot;reformists.&quot;<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">But 
        even among those who are not rendered impotent, the unilateral pursuit 
        of Liberation can take its toll. Some radical women have been so appalled 
        at the condition of most men, and the possibility of becoming even partially 
        what they are, that they have clung to the security of the role that they 
        know, to wait complacently for the Revolution to liberate everyone. Some 
        men, fearing that role reversal was a goal of the women's liberation movement, 
        have taken a similar position. Both have failed to realize that the abolition 
        of sex roles must be continually incorporated into any radical restructuring 
        of society and thus have failed to explore the possible consequences of 
        such role integration. The goal they advocate may be one of liberation, 
        but it dose not involve women's liberation.<br>
        <img src="../imagehome/spacer.gif" width="15" height="10" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" align="left">Separated 
        from each other, the Egalitarian Ethic and the Liberation Ethic can be 
        crippling, but together they can be a very powerful force. Separately 
        they speak to limited interests; together they speak to all humanity. 
        Separately, they are but superficial solutions; together they recognize 
        that while sexism oppresses women, it also limits the potentiality of 
        men. Separately, neither will be achieved because their scope does not 
        range far enough; together they provide a vision worthy of our devotion. 
        Separately, these two Ethics do not lead to the liberation of women; together, 
        they also lead to the liberation of men.<br>
