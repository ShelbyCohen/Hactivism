      ECO-ACTIVISTS &amp; SIXTIES CULTURE<br>
      IN RELATION TO THE ROMANTIC TRADITION &amp;<br>
      THE HISTORY OF IDEAS</b></font>
      <p><font size="2">by <a href="../peter.htm" target="_top">Peter Morrell</a></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <div align="left">
        <p><font size="4">There is a broad parallel between environmentalism and
        hippies --in the sense that they are broadly idealistic, seek to change
        the world and the attitudes of people in it. This is in some ways
        similar to the early Romantics. In both cases I also think they are
        definite 'reactions' to a rising dominant culture --Enlightenment then
        or scientific materialism now --which the Romantics stoutly reject as
        disturbing, unpleasant or inhumane. For example, Rousseau's ambivalence
        both towards science and organised religion is reflected today in many
        environmentalists who want to keep the best of modern scientific
        worldview and 'progress' (eg dishwashers, some bleaches and detergents,
        living in houses rather than teepees), but who then want to reject its
        nastier bits --like nuclear power, vivisection and intensive farming.
        Hippies likewise.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Being at least suspicious of, if not opposed outright
        to scientific materialism, environmentalists and hippies certainly seem
        keen to retain some kind of spiritual (or holistic) paradigm within
        their lives, but they appear to share a rejection of systems of rigid
        dogma, which they might see as being 'rammed down your throat' or
        'applied as a straitjacket' to your moral conduct. This could be the
        chief source of their reaction against most forms of orthodox religion.
        Their ruralism (pastoralism) and pantheism both evoke the 'noble savage'
        of Rousseau, as they espouse 'back to nature' and the superiority of
        'natural therapies' and 'natural lifestyles'. Along with various forms
        of Orientalism (eg. Gandhi, Zen, Confucius, Taoism), this 'naturalism'
        has to be a thread common to both movements. And probably forms, for
        example, the basis for their aversion to pesticides and chemical
        pollution. The Hindu concept of Ahimsa 'non-harming' --much promoted by
        Gandhi, has also been deeply influential in both movements. As has
        Gandhi himself, of course, as a great exemplar or living archetype.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Hippies and eco-activists also espouse sharing things,
        and benign and peaceful cooperation --both between individuals and with
        nature itself. They are both broadly anti-competitive. This 'pacifism',
        as we might choose to call it, is clearly an important characteristic
        feature they both share. It is also found to some degree (perhaps in a
        more embryonic form) amongst the early Romantics and, of course, found
        best expression both in the French Revolution (slogan 'Liberte, Egalite,
        Fraternite') and in the works of Tom Paine and the American Declaration
        of Independence -- though we would be hard-pushed to find evidence of it
        in the behaviour of the Revolutionists themselves. Nevertheless, it was
        an idea swimming around in that idealistic cocktail of ideas current at
        that time. Many before us have also traced socialism and communism to
        the profound idealism and egalitarianism of the 1790's.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">It also finds expression in the intense ruralism of
        many of the painters and poets of the early Romantic period. Thus the
        spirit of those times was also, arguably, centered about the idea of
        human dignity, freedom and friendship to all people. Indeed, it is also
        found as an integral part of the spirit of the founding fathers of the
        USA. I would venture that all of that comes very close to the egalite
        and 'commune-ism' of hippies and eco-activists. Though maybe for
        different reasons.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">It is well known that many of the first European
        Romantics were anti-industrialists, who rebelled against machines and
        the ugliest, dehumanizing excesses of industrialization. They were
        predominantly artists, writers, poets and artisans, plus 'intellectual
        ruralists' and 'sentimental non- conformists'. They gave only a guarded
        welcome and to only very few aspects of technology, rejecting most of it
        out-of-hand --again, very much like modern-day hippies and eco-activists
        -- what we might term a 'pick-and-choose eclecticism', and as I said
        before, reflecting a strong ambivalence towards science.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In the case of environmentalists, many express varying
        degrees of 'ideological discomfort' in accepting such modern things as
        clean food and water, sewage and refuse disposal, gas central heating,
        domestic electricity supply, hot water on demand, motor vehicles, etc
        --all of which are undeniable products of science-led industrialism and
        which we all seem to take for granted as essential elements of a
        civilised life. Instead, the more extremes (the 'deep greens') deny that
        such items are even desirable let alone necessary for a civilised life.
        This discomfort stems largely from their knowledge of the hidden
        price-tag of many modern benefits --a price-tag of hidden energy costs,
        pollution, animal abuse, health effects, landscape despoilation, etc.
        That is the source of their 'virtuous discomfort'. Hippies showed a
        similar contempt for the trappings of modern industrial life and a
        desire to 'go and find their own Walden Pond'. We can easily demonstrate
        that these are mainstream Romantic features. These points I would
        maintain are fairly self-evident.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">It is arguable that the early Romantics had 'already
        lost their religion' and pretty soon became equally disenchanted with
        materialist science and industry. Alternatively you might say they
        disliked industry and then lost their religion --it amounts to the same
        result. Thus they came to occupy a rather uncomfortable position in
        relation to both. We might term the philosophy they ultimately
        formulated as a form of 'sentimental humanism and the arts'. They seemed
        to believe in the dignity and sacred nature of human life, but not in
        formal religion. Science cut across one viewpoint and religion across
        the other. While this became their personal refuge and saviour,
        ideologically it 'fell between both stools' of science and religion.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The Romantic viewpoint therefore appears to stem from
        a 'cultural vacuum'; deriving from a disenchantment with and rejection
        of both ideologies on offer at the time. Or at least an ambivalent
        non-commitment towards both.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Yet it is also true --taking a different tack --that
        not all romantics were romantic, just as not all hippies were hippies or
        all peace-activists are that peaceful! Just as not all hippies live in
        teepees (or even wish to!), so not all eco-activists wreck factory farms
        or break into vivisection laboratories --so there are distinct shades of
        belief within each movement, and one presumes that these reflect
        different shades of commitment to a central pillar of ideas. In all
        these movements there exists a high degree of tolerance towards an outer
        fringe of 'casual takers' and 'intellectual migrants' (ideological
        browsers?) who come along to sit and dabble in a 'pool of ideas' for a
        time and then move on.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">To establish more concrete links between
        eco-activists/hippies and Romance, we would need to trace the more
        distant origins both of Romanticism and of what I would term, the
        'romantic impulse'.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Their anti-intellectualism might be seen as another
        aspect of their subjectivism. Their ecopolitical leanings I will touch
        on below. As for research methodology, we need to explore their language
        and communitities and ask a range of questions about them. But most of
        it it is already available to us. The literature, the songs and many of
        the individuals who went through that era and picked up its essential
        features. We can gain direct access to many of the figures of that era
        and compile an oral history, just as we can from any person who lived
        through it and shared aspects of its ideology. It is not therefore 'an
        impossible conversation'. We can make a start at it. In such a situation
        we are perfectly entitled to act as pioneers and develop our own methods
        and evaluations of this topic. If the pioneers of social science had
        paid such deference to 'theory' would, one wonders, anything have been
        discovered of lasting value?<br>
        Many people seem to believe that Hippies displayed an aspect of 60's
        culture which was very anti-establishment and rebellious. Whatever their
        historical origins in the emergent post-war pop-culture (which probably
        requires an essay in its own right), we might decide that Hippies were
        keen to reject most of the cosy and accepted middle-class norms of
        modern (ie post-war) life. In that sense they seem to bear little
        resemblance to a superficial view of the Romantics of the 19th century.
        In fact the 19th century Romantics were probably far more rebellious
        than we think.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Beats and Hippies certainly seemed to want to turn
        life upside-down and reject everything. I think this is a mistaken view
        in some respects. We should perhaps distinguish more clearly between
        60's culture as political activism, in its wider sense of being very
        clearly anti-authority and rebellious --which is one distinct thread,
        perfectly valid in its own right. But then there are also the peaceful,
        romantic, pastoral, (drug-crazed?) and mystical hippies. I think they
        might for convenience be viewed separately from the highly politicized
        rebellious sub-group (='marxists').</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Of course, it is chiefly the peace-loving Hippies I
        have been writing about, rather than the 'Marxists', and this
        distinguishes between 'hippies' per se and 'general 60's culture', I
        therefore believe that there were at least 2 distinct variants --one
        highly politicized and protesting, anti-establishment, and the other
        romantic, dreamy, artistic, pacifist and mystical. Both were rebellious
        in various ways, but the Hippies less so politically than the Marxists.
        Hippies more socially and ideologically rebellious maybe?</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">However, instead of Goethe I would more likely choose
        Blake as an archetypal 'Romantic' par excellence. Visionary, mystic,
        Swedenborgian, painter, poet, romantic dreamer, venerator of landscape
        and innocence, etc. He is a far better example of Romance. He was
        ever-changing, radical, anti-industrial, dabbled in philosophy and
        mysticism and sects and was always searching for a satisfactory
        spiritual paradigm. John Clare, Wordsworth, Shelley, Byron, Keats,
        Constable, Coleridge, Friedrich, Turner, Robert Owen, John Ruskin and
        William Morris are also profoundly typical of Romance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Getting back to the 60's...there were certainly
        internal conflicts between the two sub-groups within what can be viewed
        as a polarized movement. They each manifested pretty incompatible urges,
        but maintained a degree of apathy or tolerance towards each other,
        depending on your point of view. They certainly generated a tension
        within the movement which was very creative, though some might say there
        were two quite distinct though similarly active movements sharing the
        same time- frame, but few central dogmas. In brief we can say Hippies
        rejected violent protest as a waste of time and productive of only
        illusory social reforms. External changes in the structures of society
        do not always change the contents -- the minds and attitudes of the
        people. Thus Hippies viewed politics as rather futile tinkering with
        symptoms rather than dealing with deeper causes of society's woes. They
        thus rather sceptically regarded changes in structures as always being
        subordinate and inferior to changing people. The 'politicos' seemed to
        reject Hippies as too naive, laid-back, mystical and out of touch with
        political and social realities. I would maintain there is considerable
        mileage in both those arguments.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#ff3300"><b>Revolution</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Consideration of that 60's buzz-word 'revolution'
        clearly reveals the differences between the Marxist and Hippy wings of
        the movement. Any revolution for the Hippies was meant to be only a
        revolution in the head, a revolution of attitude, which would then
        naturally translate into improved social conduct, peaceful tolerance and
        friendship to all. But the revolution the Marxists had in mind was full-
        blooded, political and meant just what it implied: take the means of
        production out of the hands of rich capitalists and place it into the
        hands of the workers. In &gt;this&lt; sense there certainly were two
        separate, though parallel movements with entirely different aims and
        agendas. And entirely different heroes. 'Hate the rich and kill the rich
        -- even, eat the rich' could easily have been a slogan of the Marxists,
        but never of the Hippies.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">We might very profitably analyse the language used in
        the movement. And this leads us into some very interesting territory.
        Words like 'protest', 'rebellion,' 'liberation', 'natural',
        'revolution', 'underground', 'alternative' and 'freedom' emerge as being
        very typical of 60's culture generally and probably equally so amongst
        eco-activists and Hippies.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In the case of the word 'natural', the underlying idea
        is that it clearly means fresh and pure; it means unadulterated,
        untainted, unblemished, pristine, organic and undamaged. It means
        unrefined and unchemicalized too. It thus means safe, harmless, good for
        you and holistic. The opposite, therefore, unnatural, is equated with
        the opposites of the above: refined, impure, false, chemicalized,
        corrupted, tainted, synthetic, adulterated and thus bad, harmful and
        damaging. Thus when we see this word natural in use in 60's talk it
        means organic and wholesome, good for you. That is its meaning when used
        in 'natural foods', 'natural living', natural community', 'natural
        energy' and 'natural therapies'. By implication it means harmless,
        benign and in harmony with nature and living things. That is its
        ecological credential card.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In the case of the word 'free' we find the following
        synonyms and contexts: natural, pure, good, flowing, creative, loose,
        safe, open, therapeutic, liberation, liberated, wild, energetic, good
        for you, let it out, let it come out, let it all hang out, catharsis,
        express yourself, free expression, free association, free thinker, free
        living, etc. Thus what is not free is the opposite and is therefore bad
        because it is --illiberal, unliberated, tight, uptight, suppressed,
        oppressed, repressed, held in, unhealthy, bad, hidden, closed, wound up,
        etc.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">We could repeat this type of analysis for other words
        like 'rebellion' and 'protest' and I think we would come to similar
        conclusions. These words seem to lay bare the 'mental processes' of the
        movement and form a mirror for the culture of the time. Such terms and
        recurring themes can be found in almost every aspect of 60's culture and
        the Hippy movement. They crop up in and thoroughly permeate such
        subjects as food, health, landscape, lifestyle, poetry, pop music,
        painting, politics, travel, education, writing and psychology --to name
        a few. They can, of course, all be found embedded in great abundance in
        the song-lyrics of the whole period 1955- 75.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#ff3300"><b>Rebellion</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Much has been made of the rebelliousness of the
        period. Many things can be said about it. It might be seen as merely a
        device, a means of achieving liberation from those who would oppress,
        suppress and repress --usually parents, teachers, college, employers.
        Leary's famous injunction to 'turn on, tune in and drop out' was thus a
        motto for becoming liberated FROM all that and 'loosening up' to such a
        degree --with the aid of dope, acid, etc --as to reach a better
        lifestyle, gain deeper spiritual insights (?), greater self-esteem and
        happiness, 'do your own thing' and generally 'hang out' with others of
        your own kind.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">This type of thinking also permeated the
        anti-schooling and deschooling writings of Goodman and Illich. It was
        proposed as a means of liberation from the oppressive ideals and
        lifestyles forced upon youth by parents, teachers, employers, etc. The
        deschooling concept also elevated the status of youth from one of
        immature naivety to innate wisdom --another favourite theme of the
        Hippies and more distantly reminiscent of Rousseau's noble savage. The
        rebellion 'in the school' thus comprised an escape from
        teacher-oppression and the creation of an alternative (youth-centred)
        culture. And it is when we come to mention this word 'alternative' that
        we touch a major ganglion of 60's culture. That was the word on
        everybody's lips from the great 'icons' of the movement like Leary and
        Ginsberg all the way down to the lowliest dopehead.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The rebelliousness also manifested as
        anti-intellectualism, precisely because intellectuals --eg teachers and
        professionals --could be construed as yet another potent group of
        oppressors trying to ram their culture down your throat and tell you
        what to think and say and feel, and that whatever viewpoint you had
        arrived at about the world, through your own thinking, was somehow
        unimportant, trivial, inferior and secondary in comparison to theirs.
        The dialogue in books and films of that period clearly reveals this
        trend. The phraseology of parents and other adults at that time implies
        that 'kids' have not experienced enough, know nothing, have heads filled
        with crazy ideas, are thoroughly irresponsible, must be told and shown
        what to do and are a danger to themselves and society at large without
        this control and domination by adults. Adults were thus party to a
        conspiracy against the 'raw and natural' viewpoint of the young.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In many respects, the whole 60's phenomenon can be
        viewed as a period of rebellion. The rebellion by youth against the
        apparently oppressive domination from adults and the desire to gain a
        'cultural momentum', derived from accumulating sufficient alternative
        culture (songs, literature, drugs, lifestyle) and social confidence of
        their own to be able to tell adults exactly where they can go and stuff
        a 'culture' the 'kids' have decided to reject wholesale. Thus the
        counterculture was saying a big NO to all that and a big YES to youth
        and their own intuitive insights about the world we live in. To me there
        is little doubt, that Leary, Ginsberg and Co were encouraging youth to
        rebel against authority and to take greater confidence in their own
        viewpoints and in developing their own alternative forms of culture. And
        to continue gaining greater confidence in doing this. And to resist and
        repel any criticism from adults.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#ff3300"><b>Orientalism</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The rebellion against intellectuals probably also
        stems from a devotion to naturalism and the hatred of sophistry. Hippies
        tended to strongly dislike cant, humbug and high-faluting gobbledegook,
        preferring instead clear, down-to-earth, simple descriptions and natural
        spontaneity. Afterall they were 'flower people'! They emphasised the
        primacy of direct simple experience. This is also reflected in their
        love of Zen Buddhism, which is a deeply iconoclastic religious
        tradition, that had cut the vast and complex structure of Indian
        Buddhism down (first in China, then in Japan) to its barest meditative
        essentials and also stressed simplicity and the central importance of
        direct viewing, direct experience and a mocking contempt for philosophy,
        complexity and intellectual scholasticism. The sheer hatred Zen
        generated for the flowery excesses of Indian Buddhism is superbly
        condensed in the iconoclastic book title: 'If you meet the Buddha kill
        him!'.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Hence the importance of Alan Watts and D T Suzuki, who
        brought Zen into the Western mind. I believe this love of simplicity to
        be an important if neglected aspect of the movement, which manifested
        also in art, design, poetry, music and fashion; in recycling of clothes
        and in the link with the ecopolitics in general. Simplicity is venerated
        both as an end in itself and also out of practical usefulness. I am not
        saying that everything the Hippies did was practical, down-to-earth and
        useful, however! For example, the much-lampooned organic diets and
        macrobiotic vegetarianism involved chewing a rather bland mixture of
        brown rice, chick peas and undercooked pulses and vegetables, with the
        total conviction that you were chewing your way towards perfect health
        and some higher meditative state! And that doing this would change the
        world!</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Another example of this stark minimalism can be seen
        in the fad for Haiku poetry, in minimalist music, sitar and koto music
        and the adoration of frugality and recycling --typical of Hippies and
        ecologists. Again, it strikes us as a form of anti- intellectual
        simplicity and a love of clarity. It also links straight to pacifism and
        non- harming, mentioned already, and to the ideas of a 'no waste'
        lifestyle that has minimal impact. It also mates up with the general
        orientalism.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">However, we should remember that both Zen and 60's
        culture were not just simplicity-loving, they were also strongly
        'plebeian', in the sense that they both stressed direct access to the
        'inner teachings' by any ordinary person and that no great in-depth
        study or preparation was required for someone to become an expert. The
        expert was another plague upon their freedom to just 'be'.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">They shared a contempt for experts and that formed a
        further basis for their anti- intellectualism. In their language they
        might say 'You don't need a PhD to become cool! The only 'credentials'
        you need, man, are some dope and a few tabs of acid!' In that sense many
        were inspired to leave university and 'drop out' of the mainstream. An
        act which was loudly applauded by the leaders of the movement as a very
        courageous step to take. We might say that this again reveals their
        paranoia about control from others (eg parents and intellectuals) and
        that their obsession with 'throwing off the shackles' was such a
        dominant thread. To what extent their rebellion was more perceived than
        real is hard to say. Another connection here comes again with
        orientalism, the bland simplicity of which touched psychology in a big
        way. The Zen injunction that just by sitting gazing at a wall will solve
        all your hang-ups was taken seriously, and the big impact of orientalism
        upon therapy and counselling since mid-60's is well-documented: eg Laing
        and Szasz as much-revered debunkers of psychiatry.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">However, this debunking and anti-jargon strand is far
        less true of the Marxist wing of the movement, members of which were
        more than happy to discuss at length with you their abstruse and
        tortuous interpretations of Marx, Lenin, Trotsky and the doings and
        writings of Che Guevara, Mao and Castro.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Though Rachel Carson's epoch-making 'Silent Spring'
        was published in 1963, little tangible happened until the campaigning
        skills of 60's activists --post-student riots, post-civil rights,
        post-drug campaigning --were brought to bear upon the subject and took
        the environmental movement into the hearts and minds of the masses. That
        did not start in 1963, but towards the end of the 60's and even into the
        early 70's. It is therefore arguable that Carson's work might well have
        'fallen on deaf ears' completely were it not for the Hippies who chimed
        with it, took it up, refashioned it, vocalized it, made a cause out of
        it and carried it into a real movement in its own right. In this sense,
        therefore, eco-activism comes after Hippies and is deeply indebted to
        them. It is indelibly stamped with their vision of the world. It rode
        piggy-back on their earlier, ground-breaking campaigning of the 60's. It
        shares their non-harming pacifism and love of organics.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#ff3300"><b>Romantics</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Having looked in this way at some of the main themes
        of 60's culture, we are now in a good position to do the same for the
        19th century Romance movement and to bring out some of the incredible
        parallels which I think reside just below the surface. In both, we find
        the massive flowering of Romance, creativity, art, poetry and
        literature. In both we find rebellion against the established order of
        oppressors, pacifistic experiments in communal living, experiments in
        socialist education, dabbling with recreational drugs, early forms of
        environmentalism, sexual liberalism and an incipient undercurrent of
        orientalism. Both are anti-science, anti-materialism,
        anti-industrialism. They are broad-church and Bohemian, anti-expert,
        deeply humanistic, exuberant and life-affirmative. Both stand against
        the dead-end nihilism of a world dominated by science and devoid of any
        form of spirituality. In both we find the critique and rejection of
        mainstream culture and the setting up of a liberal, laissez-faire
        alternative, 'underground' culture, run chiefly (as with Hippies) by
        intellectual rebels who soon became the iconic 'darlings' of the
        movement.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The underlying threads in each era are very similar,
        but they reach the surface differently. For example, in the 19th century
        the most important drug was opium, rather than hashish, the orientalism
        was newly-discovered Hinduism, Buddhism and Theosophy, plus the
        mysticism of the Near East, along with interest in magic, paganism,
        phrenology, spiritualism, ancient Egyptian religion, etc. The socialism,
        communal living and deschooling we find in Robert Owen, John Ruskin and
        William Morris and their many associates. The art and literature are so
        familiar as to need no mention. The environmentalism surfaced chiefly as
        a reverence for the sanctity and purity of landscape and mountains,
        collecting plants from around the world and building stunning gardens.
        The social rebellions and political dissent were focused mainly against
        those tangible evils of poverty, inequality, privilege, class struggles,
        industrialism, worker's rights, colonialism, slavery, suffrage and the
        stifling oppression of social and religious conformity.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The 'philosophers' include Thoreau, Emerson and
        Whitman in the US, Robert Owen, William Morris, Bergson, the Rossettis,
        plus the impressive 'authority' of the grand corpus of all creative
        works of the early Romantic poets and painters like Wordsworth, Keats,
        Shelley, Coleridge, Byron, Turner, Constable, Blake, John Clare,
        Friedrich and other intense pastoralists. There is also perchance a
        parallel between the sexual liberty of the 60's and the indulgence of
        prostitution in 19th century Paris, London and Berlin. Both might be
        seen as offshoots of the visual arts, and especially the liberality of
        painters of the nude --which was compulsory training for the serious art
        student in all European Art Schools. This liberality was chiefly found
        in Paris, where toleration of transvestism, prostitution, fetishism and
        homosexuality was also apparently 'de rigeur'.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">From this cursory glance, I think it is fairly clear
        that the two periods manifest some very strong parallels, even though
        the early Romantic period was quite long, lasting roughly from the
        1730's to 1900, while we might conveniently stretch the Beat &amp;
        Hippies era to a max of 20 years, lasting from c1955-75. This difference
        in span is probably a reflection of differences of speed of life and the
        communication systems available in each period. As I hope I have shown,
        both periods seem to share an underlying fabric of common aims and
        purposes and very similar themes, subjects and activities. Indeed, the
        Beat and Hippy period is very like a miniature revisitation of the 19th
        century artistic renaissance. Just as creative, just as challenging,
        just as rebellious, just as mystical, just as liberal, though briefer
        and thus glowing brighter and more intensely than its natural
        'grandparent'.</font></p>

        the above ideas with some quotes from:</font></p>

        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#ff3300"><b>More Distant Origins</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">To sort out the more distant origins of Romance we
        might strive to show by stages how Martin Luther and King Henry VIII (of
        England) can in many ways be regarded as the founders of the modern
        worldview.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As the joint founders of the Reformation, they set
        freethinking going by releasing societies in N Europe from the iron grip
        of the Roman Church. This, combined with printing, not only set minds
        buzzing with new ideas, but enabled folk to communicate their new ideas
        to each other. This entirely new situation - the Reformation - continued
        into the 1600's and 1700's a process which gave rise to two main
        developments within protestant N Europe (chiefly England, Netherlands,
        Germany):</font></p>
        <ul>
          <p><font size="4">a. the beginnings of science as a possible
          worldview, ie. freethinking about the way the world is/might be - as
          opposed to the received view of Christian dogma, and...</font></p>
          <p><font size="4">b. the active search by such freed minds for
          alternative systems of philosophy --eg Descartes, Locke, Hume, which
          could explain the workings of the world. They were essentially
          materialistic philosophies (except that of Berkeley) --chiefly through
          a distinct and entirely new 'turning outwards' away from religious
          dogma and towards the outer physical world.</font></p>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="4">This new situation in turn gave rise to a new breed of
        people *with a sceptical view of religion*, *with little or no religion
        at all* and certainly with *very few deeply- held preconceptions about
        the world around them*, but with the beginnings of a devotion to
        scientific materialism as an upcoming ideology, which showed, to them,
        great promise. Combine all this with further economic expansion,
        scientific experimentation and the gradual winning of political freedoms
        (especially in US, England, Holland and eventually France) it gave rise
        to discoveries which would lead to industrialism. It also led directly
        to the Enlightenment, centred chiefly in France --ironically in a
        country still under the twin grip of the Church and the Sun King, Louis
        XIV --the very archetype of the old-style European king.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">It also gave rise to the 'agricultural revolution' in
        the early 1700's and then the 'industrial revolution' somewhat later. In
        both, traditional and slow, people-based craft and 'cottage industries'
        (and ways of doing things) became first threatened and then eclipsed, by
        faster methods using machines. First mechanical machines and then
        steam-driven ones. The use of coal, iron, steam-power and railways led
        straight into the often dehumanizing mass-production methods of the
        'machine age' and factory. These are all fairly tangible and concrete
        manifestations --as if we need reminding --of scientific materialism.
        Yet while some continued (in studied ignorance?) to paint idyllic rural
        scenes, signifying the sanctity of landscape (eg Gainsbrough, Constable,
        Friedrich), many Romantics condemned the grim industrial scenes, yet
        felt fascinated enough to paint some of them, (eg. Turner, Joseph
        Wright, Loutherbourg, Blechen, Cotman). And even the arch-romantic
        Constable's superb 'Brighton Beach with Colliers' (1824) reveals what a
        time of contrasts, change and ambivalence it really must have been.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">After the Reformation, the non-Catholic Christian
        religion quite literally splintered into a thousand fragments or sects.
        They were all attempts - it is arguable - to become free from whatever
        'oppressor' their perception inspired them to rebel against. They were
        also experiments in liberty and freedom to choose. Celebrations in their
        various ways of personal liberty as well as reaffirmation of distinctive
        personal religious revelation. This is just as true of Swedenborg
        (1688-1772), Luther (1483- 1546) and Wesley (1703-91) as it was about
        Calvin (1509-64) and George Fox (1624-91).</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">It is rather sad that today we all carry with us at
        least a rudimentary sketch in our heads about the development of science
        - which seems grossly to dominate our every breath - while very few of
        us have a similar sketch about Romance, or art or philosophy or history
        of ideas. The balance that tipped towards domination by science and away
        from the arts needs to move back.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#ff3300"><b>Reformation</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Getting back to Romance, the Protestant tradition
        arose and mainly thrived in England, Holland and Germany, also
        Scandinavia - the north of Europe in general rebelled against the
        tyranny of the Pope and Catholic Church in the 1520's and 1530's. As a
        result it shook itself free from those tight controls on printing,
        beliefs and developed freedoms for people to say, do, write and think
        what they liked. Knowing this link with Protestantism helps us to
        understand the social progress of homeopathy.</font></p>
        <ul>
          <p><font size="4"><i>'The Church felt more or less clearly that the
          growth of knowledge was a menace to its own position.' [Rogers, p.206]</i></font></p>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="4">Printing is another key theme because...once printing
        really got going (originally in the 1400's) it was dynamite. The Church
        had sat on huge heretical tracts for centuries and thus very much
        controlled the beliefs of the people. Once printing liberated people's
        freedom of thought and belief there was no longer any constraint upon
        open dialogue and free intercourse of ideas - political, philosophical,
        religious, etc. To begin with of course, printing was not very
        contentious because it was mainly liturgical and under the full control
        of the Church. But that didn't last long and people started printing
        things that were more secular, and which might be banned as heretical,
        eg Galileo (1564-1642) - his whole collision with the Church forms a
        splendid example.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">It is also an example of the way societies try and
        deal with deviance. Turning to the modern era, it is very little
        different from the way Science (nowadays in many ways the social
        equivalent of the mediaeval Church) has treated people like Velikovsky,
        Cold Fusion, Sheldrake, Uri Geller, Gauquelin and Benveniste...to name a
        few. Heresy cannot be tolerated and must be invalidated, squashed and
        intimidated: deviantised and demonised to the nth degree. How far have
        we actually progressed at all, one wonders?! That follows essentially
        the same pattern as their treatment of alternative medicine and
        astrology</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Thus the Protestant tradition can be viewed as a
        tradition of reaction by individuals against the powerful forces of mass
        control and autocratic social control - ie. the Mediaeval Church - and
        pushing towards greater and greater reform and liberalisation. They were
        also forces which controlled belief. Those forces were successfully
        challenged and gradually broken down so that people could believe
        whatever they wanted, say what they wanted and practice what they
        wanted. They have obtained these freedoms - only painfully slowly and in
        a piecemeal fashion. So throughout the 1600's and 1700's in the North
        European countries these freedoms were first won and then indulged and
        explored. In philosophy, in science, in the arts - all these made very
        rapid progress, dogmas and superstitions being chucked overboard and new
        ideas emerging to replace them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Thus the Protestant countries became the centre of a
        huge expansion of human knowledge. Science and philosophy (which at that
        time were indistinguishable) was the first big expanding area of
        knowledge and a natural result of people having the freedom to look at
        the world and figure things out for themselves, instead of being TOLD
        what to believe. This was the replacement of superstition and 'received
        dogma' with natural inquisitiveness, direct insight and independent
        thought (rationalism). It is no coincidence, geographically, that all
        this mainly emerged in Germany, England, Holland and France, also
        Scandinavia and Switzerland - not the mediterranean Catholic countries
        (except Galileo et al). They were predominantly Protestant areas, in
        which people had much greater freedom to say what they wanted with
        impunity.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#ff3300"><b>Romance</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The Romantics came next and were very largely reacting
        against the lack of spirit and mystique in much of the mechanical and
        materialistic notions being thrown up by 'raw science'. Reactions
        against materialism in its various guises. They wanted the freedom and
        the liberty of thought and ideas that Protestantism and science had
        brought, but they also wanted a little more romance and sentimentality
        than they were getting. They rejected out of hand the idea that we are
        just automatons as Hobbes (1588-1679) and Descartes (1596-1650), and
        later Newton (1642-1727), had proposed. They wanted to live in a world
        containing some bliss, optimism and love and not a dead-end, cold,
        uncaring, nihilistic machine-type universe. They were also very
        concerned about the way mechanisation seemed all too often to translate
        into brutal economic exploitation of labour at a social level and the
        way machines were destroying people's traditional lifestyles and
        occupations, crafts, etc. That was another more overtly politicised
        strand.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Thus the romantics were passionate about nature, fresh
        air, clean water, good sweet nature, food, sweet things in life and
        beautiful pictures as well as wonderful music, etc. Mozart (1756-91),
        Keats (1795- 1821), Shelley (1792-1822), Byron (1788-1824), Wordsworth
        (1770-1850), Constable (1776-1837), Stubbs (1724-1806), Turner
        (1775-1851), et al are all good examples of that strand. That tradition
        is still active and spans right through to modern times. But it has
        always tended to have a religious element because people do tend to want
        to believe in something spiritual rather than nothing (nihilism) and
        other than molecules and mechanical watches that run the universe.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">So some religious belief - pantheism even - teams up
        with Romanticism time and again. Indeed, the romantic movement itself
        fed hungrily on a vast diet of alternative religions, the Greek myths,
        the Roman and pagan religions, NeoPlatonism, ideas from the orient and
        also from Druids and pagan European beliefs. Thus Romantic tradition
        reached back to older European roots, predating Christianity and that
        was not at all popular! This is very apparent in the visual arts and
        theatre, but also in novels and poetry. The artists like Blake as I said
        before, were drawing upon these unChristian and anti-Christian
        traditions. That includes esoteric and secret traditions like
        Paracelsus, magic, Kabbala, Swedenborg, occult, Knight's Templars,
        Rosicrucians, and all types of mythology, etc. Opium and Cannabis also
        become important features - Wordsworth, Coleridge (1772-1834), De
        Quincey (1785-1859), Southey (1774-1843) et al, and later Baudelaire
        (1821-67) &amp; Co.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">It is arguable that the Romantics have had 4 major
        phases of expansion and flowering. The first was coincident with the
        Reformation and included the Italian artistic Renaissance - even though
        that was still mainly working with religious forms. The second would be
        the flowering we normally think of as the Romantic period in literature,
        art and music, c1700-1890. The third would be the Cubist, Dadist and
        Surrealism movement roughly 1900-1940, and the fourth has been the whole
        Pop music phenomenon say 1956-present, and especially the psychedelic
        era c1964-1978, which was a particularly fertile, prolific and
        articulate period of artistic and political upheaval and expression.
        These phases are also marked by intervening periods of relative
        quiescence during which a degree of digestion and realignment occurs of
        the manifestations of the preceeding epoch. The environmental thing is
        also an expression of Romanticism. Homeopathy and all alternative
        therapies also show clear links with the Romantic tradition.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Most typically homeopathy is essentially spiritual and
        anti-science (anti mechanism). It is essentially vitalistic and rejects
        the materialistic diktat that matter is the cause of everything or the
        only reality. It re-affirms the spiritual nature of the human and animal
        worlds. In the case of homeopathy, it arises as a queer mix of science
        and romanticism. Religious belief seems to be confirmed by homeopathy
        and that is perhaps one reason why it was very popular with clerics in
        all countries and the preferred medical system amongst their kind. That
        can and did go both ways - towards traditional Christianity and towards
        pagan beliefs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">As for books, Bertrand Russell's History of Western
        Philosophy gives a brisk and uneven account - concentrating only on main
        figures, while Arthur Kenyon Rogers' A Student's History of Philosophy
        (Macmillan, 3rd Edition, 1935, US - quoted above) is nothing short of
        brilliant, as it gives all the background history of ideas that Russell
        misses out. It still lacks detail though. Schenk's The Mind of the
        European Romantics (Constable, 1966, London) is also an excellent source
        of ideas and details. Tarnas is also excellent and also Berlin's many
        essays in this field.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I therefore trace the roots of Romance both as a
        *reaction against* the Enlightenment (and thus against science) to
        *protests against* the ugliest excesses of early industrialization in N
        Europe and also to the weakening grip of organised religious dogma on
        the hearts and minds of the people. Romance therefore comprises a
        *reaction against* scientific materialism and the ugliness of
        industrialism as 'outrages visited upon the human spirit'. It is equally
        a *reaction against* the loss of faith in organised religion and the
        grim spiritual nihilism which that seemed to invoke in the minds of
        many. A view of the universe as a mechanical machine, and humans running
        around like automatons with no minds, is a fairly justified
        interpretation to make of the same clockwork vision conjured up by folks
        like Hobbes, Descartes and Newton, whether it was intended by them in
        that way or not.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Thus, from 1700's on through to 1900's we find folks
        searching for spiritual meaning and reassurance in a darkening world. It
        is my contention that that search still continues now and occasionally
        erupts into new movements such as Hippies and eco-activism. It is a
        process which is still active and which may never die out completely. As
        I am sure many hippies and eco-activists would say: meaning might prove
        ultimately to be a far more precious commodity to us than the myriad,
        tangible, material comforts which science and technology have bestowed
        upon us --as also implied in the end of the film 'Silent Running'. Or as
        also seen in the more recent events at Waco and the San Diego Hale-Bopp
        mass suicide. These might be seen as genuine searches for meaning in an
        apparently uncaring and mechanistic universe.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In the above senses, therefore, I find it fairly
        transparent that Hippies and Eco- activists appear before us as slighty
        'different fruits' on the same 'tree' as their forebears, the Romantics.
        And thus from this thesis, we might decide that Romance, even in our
        modern, science-dominated world, could be perceived as a genuinely
        perennial philosophy, with strong roots seeming to plunge down deep into
        our collective psyche. And which seem periodically to throw up vibrant
        new shoots of renewed activity --and even vigorous growth --no matter
        how efficiently or frequently its gnarled old branches get hacked down
        by what we might term the 'chain-saw of scientific progress'. In this
        sense therefore, I am tempted to disagree with the notion that Romance
        is ending --transforming itself again, maybe, yes, but surely never
        truly ending.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Finally, I am tempted to conclude that the 'romantic
        impulse' has always existed and is an integral part of our
        consciousness. Periodically, it gets abused, chopped down, and buried,
        but then it reappears, strangely new, shining, Phoenix-like,
        hydra-headed, gussied up in new clothes, as new ideologies, which seem
        radically different, but which, upon closer inspection share an
        underlying golden thread which runs through them all - they are branches
        from the same tree. And that tradition we can surely trace back even
        further, before the Enlightenment and beyond the Renaissance into
        Neoplatonism --Plotinus, Eriugena, and then back to Plato and the
        Greats. And also through the secret traditions back to Ancient Egypt,
        Pythagoras and the like.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#ff3300"><b>Decline of hippies</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">We now come to another problem of why they declined
        and faded from view. Well they faded very slowly and were still around
        up to 1980 or so in considerable numbers. They seemed to diminish very
        fast in the early 80's and were gone completely by 1986. Perhaps many of
        their ideals had been realised in a discreet and subtle way. People did
        become more loosened up and liberated and aware of sexism, ecology and
        mind expansion, but it did not change the world. The longed-for
        revolution did not come and 'Jerusalem was not builded here'. In that
        sense disappointment set in and it gradually faded. The movement had
        failed to change those large and immovable structures of all societies.
        Dope and acid were not legalised and they probably never were the
        panacea for all society's ills as extolled by Leary and Ginsberg. Thus
        the dream turned sour and faded, persisting only here and there in a
        dwindling pockets of followers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Further RamblingsWe have so far been stressing that
        60's contained at least two subcultural strands --pacifistic hippies and
        Marxists. We can probably go further and call it a 'multithreaded'
        culture or period and that enables us to identify several strands within
        it. For example, there were straight dopefiends, there were vegetarian
        and wholistic health organics and environmental types; there were pure
        politicos such as the Marxists, Maoists, anarchists etc; there were also
        pure pop music and rock music freaks who did not go for the other stuff
        entirely but were just eclectic according to their own tastes; finally
        there were the Leary and Ginsberg free-wheeling, change-the-world
        through dope and free love types. You could go on identifying more and
        more fine splits within the movement and between the different factions,
        but if we just choose to say there were many different subtypes within a
        two-way split culture I think that will suffice.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Two questions therefore arise: first --why were they
        sharing ONE culture if they were so different? And second, what features
        actually united them into one culture? These are opposite sides of the
        same coin. Were they one culture and agreeing on everything? I don't
        think so --we both have shown various ways in which they were quite
        distinct from one another. Therefore we need to identify those common
        underlying ideas which they did share and which broadly identify them as
        'sixties' persons.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I would provisionally suggest that all the sub-groups
        basically shared (at least) the following features in common:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="4">youth</font>
          <li><font size="4">the new - neophiliacs</font>
          <li><font size="4">music</font>
          <li><font size="4">freedom of expression</font>
          <li><font size="4">liberality eg. dope and sex</font>
          <li><font size="4">artistic expression in its very broadest and most
            generous sense (including even the crassest stuff!)</font>
          <li><font size="4">idealism</font>
          <li><font size="4">change the world - that change is possible</font>
          <li><font size="4">revolution</font>
          <li><font size="4">change the person in their head and you change the
            world</font>
          <li><font size="4">change the world and society and structure and you
            can change people in their heads</font>
          <li><font size="4">change just for change sake</font>
          <li><font size="4">tolerance of all viewpoints and ideas</font>
          <li><font size="4">demonstrate and protest against what you dislike
            and for what you do want or just</font>
          <li><font size="4">drop-out and set up your own alternative culture</font>
          <li><font size="4">do your own thing - have confidence in doing what
            is right for you</font>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="4">Once we identify these common strands which underpin
        the whole era we can then see that the differences between the various
        subgroups were more apparent than real and that they all 'swam in the
        same river' to such a huge degree that these differences did not really
        matter very much. Nor did they add up in any big-deal way to make a huge
        difference most of the time. Any so-called friction between the
        different subgroups was minimal because there was a vast terrain of
        commonality, of basic flow-of-events which everyone approved of and
        agreed about. They approved of most things that happened because most
        things that happened were in accord with the above list and therefore
        obtained the approval of all. That was true for a remarkably long period
        of time: from late the 50's right through to mid-70's -- generally
        speaking.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Then it began to break up, became stale, people split
        off into much more distinct groups and, most important of all, the
        underpinning framework of commonality began to fragment and break up.
        The attraction for freedom of expression and the new and youth and art
        began to fade and people began to become obsessed with other things like
        jobs, money, partners and children, buying a house, etc and the whole
        dream faded from view and moved from centre-stage into a blurred
        background. Reasons? Shifts of viewpoint? tired of doing the same old
        thing? new perspectives? new attractions? boredom?</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Anyhow, the frictions that were previously happily
        tolerated as minor and insignificant now became amplified and massively
        important and that may be why in retrospective analyses everyone sees
        the decade in radically different ways. And that is why its
        interpretation in the media, and its digestion in the public mind, has
        been so problematic and why so many diverse ideas have sprung up about
        what the decade meant and what its underlying vices and virtues actually
        were.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The end of the Hippy period is difficult to pinpoint,
        in many ways it just faded slowly through the mid-70's. Its essence was
        certainly still around strongly in 1976. But my guess is that the rise
        of violent anti-past-glory Punk in 1976-80, the election of right-wing
        dictatorial figures like Thatcher (May 1979) and Reagan (1980), and the
        shooting of Lennon in Dec 1980 certainly seemed to contribute to its
        'rapid terminal illness' and probably drove the final nails into its
        coffin. Punk is an essay in its own right, of course! And it is very
        much an anti-authority thing again, but ugly, repulsive, violent
        excesses and most definitely anti-hippy and anti-laid-back man and let
        it all hang out!</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">This reminds me of The Who. I don't think they were
        quite that antipolitical. They were apolitical, perhaps, but most
        definitely anti-authority, anti-old people, anti-establishment,
        anti-Tory, anti-stuffy old fusspots who ran the place, etc etc. They had
        very violent stage-shows and a violent, manic drummer.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="4" color="#ff3300"><b>Some Song Lyrics</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">It is useful to compare Lennon's 'Revolution' with
        Harrison's 'Within you Without you' because it illustrates what I have
        said before and above. It might actually be bettter to compare some
        Dylan stuff as well, or to bring in Donovan, the Who, String Band or
        Pete Seeger et al to illustrate other important viewpoints.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">'Within you Without you' contains the following lines:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <p><font size="4"><i>' people - who hide themselves behind a wall of
          illusion<br>
          never glimpse the truth<br>
          then its far too late<br>
          when they pass away...<br>
          'with our love we could save the world...<br>
          'try to realise its all within yourself<br>
          no-one else can make you change...<br>
          '...and the people<br>
          who gain the world and lose their soul<br>
          they don't know --they can't see --are you one of them?'</i></font></p>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="4">The above is very similar to 'all you need is love'
        and carries a message that only love can really change the world because
        only it changes people in their hearts and also that cash and wealth and
        power and status are NOT the answer and do not lead to happiness, peace
        of mind, etc in the way people think. They just add to your problems
        rather than solve them. So there was a definite friction between what
        the 'peace and love' hippies were saying and what the Marxists were
        saying. It is clear and undeniable. That is what I meant by two
        polarised sub-groups or movements coexisting within one broader
        movement. Also in this song is the idea that only internal change within
        YOU can change you or your own world, NOT external changes, and, more
        importantly, not externally imposed changes in the structure of society
        as recommended by Marxists. That at least is one interpretation. It is
        certainly the interpretation I placed on it throughout the period we
        have been discussing.</font></p>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <p><font size="4">'Revolution':</font></p>
            <p><font size="4"><i>you say you want a revolution<br>

          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="4">This poem is clearly a tirade against a certain type
        of revolution which involves 'hate the rich, kill the rich' as I
        previously said. And Lennon wants no part of that. BUT he does want a
        revolution of free minds and free heads which is peaceful and a la
        Ginsberg and Leary --perhaps a slightly diluted version of what they
        were offering maybe. Lennon had obviously thought about both types of
        revolution on offer at the time and decided he wanted a soft blend of
        both rather than the raw extremes which were available. 'Shout: The True
        Story of the Beatles', by Philip Norman, on pages 294-5 is a brilliant
        condensed outline of the hippy phenomenon.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The structures of society are not changed through
        sitting and smoking dope --getting high. BUT nor are people *changed
        within* by changing the structures of society. So both are right in
        their critique of each other. AND the hippies seem more 'right' than the
        Marxists in the last analysis, because it does not matter *what* you
        change in society, if people are fundamentally unhappy in their hearts
        then no real change has been effected. And material gain is not
        happiness.' That is the hippy view and it is still mostly my own view. I
        think it is a sensible view. While hippies were dreamers and naive, so
        were Marxists -- but while the latter dreamed that their *actions* would
        change the world, the hippies dreamed their *inaction* could change the
        world. Maybe both were right and wrong in different ways, but to me the
        Marxists were more profoundly wrong and they would cause pain and
        suffering as well -- which the hippies did not cause.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The term hippy is just a convenient phrase --it has a
        blurred meaning perhaps. But I still think it has a quite distinct
        meaning compared with Marxist and I do believe both groups existed,
        dominated the movement, were not very compatible and DID generate a
        tension within the movement and even within individuals.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I do not accept Koestler's theme of 'yogi and
        commissar' which seems trite and simplistic -- a borrowed argument that
        rings hollow. In my view state and big business are/were antithetical as
        business was to make *certain people* rich period. State was at least
        aiming to benefit all, not just an elite. Business was never condoned by
        hippies. It was tolerated.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The 'sense of unity' theme dominating those times, or
        'commonality' was a form of 'brotherhood/sisterhood' rather than unity.
        It was as if everyone sailed like 'boats in the same river' for a time
        and there was a unifying sense of experience and togetherness.
        Togetherness -- now there's a 60's buzz-word par excellence!</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The nature of art also became a very important theme
        in the 60's. I think one of the main 'purposes' of all art is to portray
        and enter into that search for reintegration of self and world and to
        achieve a renewed balance. For many it is surely the sole purpose of
        their life. Art is thus v often both a portrayal of the search and the
        product of it, both at once.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">I do not agree that it is impossible to regain entry
        into that 'Eden-world' of childhood. I think many in fact do achieve
        that in a sense and it is arguable that the Romantic poets did achieve
        that fairly successfully. I do not accept that children *only* dwell in
        the NOW. They also occasioanlly drift into reverie of past and future,
        but you are right that they are more centred in the now than anywhere
        else. Also, it is not entirely true that we adults cannot view directly
        or see the world as children do. I think again it is far more complex
        and some of the time we do see things directly. The distinction between
        childhood and adulthood is perhaps false. Maybe there are cultural
        filters on our perception through growing up which act against the
        direct view you mention. These are Wordsworth's conventions maybe.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The refined state of the poet is also in many ways
        akin to the rarified states of consciousness described by mystics and
        meditators of all types and in all cultures and epochs. There is a
        parallel I suppose in wanting to be in that pure state whether in
        nature, away from others and also in the 'child's state' of innocence
        and direct viewing. I think these are most certainly centrally important
        features of idealist and romantic thought. They also crop up in the
        recreational use of drugs as they were attempts, arguably, to reach back
        into that primordial state of 'pre-adultness' and direct viewing by
        using mind-altering substances. Drug use was mainly Opium in the last
        century, but as we know in the 'romantic hippy sixties' epoch it was
        chiefly marijuhana and LSD. I think there is a parallel again because
        hippies were like Wordsworth wishing to separate themselves off from a
        corrupted (as they saw it) world and to enter into a pure childlike
        state. I think the hippy parallels with Blake and Wordsworth are
        striking.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The 60's also dwelled upon such things as incense,
        (joss-sticks) Dali, Escher, Tarot, I Ching, astrology, Herman Hesse,
        meditation, Ouija boards, Brautigan, Mervyn Peake novels, political
        demonstrations and Sartre, to name a few more.</font></p>
