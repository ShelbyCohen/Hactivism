<h1 align=center>The Arts and Crafts Movement </h1>

The Arts and Crafts movement initially developed in England during the
latter half of the 19th century. Subsequently this style was taken up by
American designers, with somewhat different results. In the United States, the
Arts and Crafts style was also known as Mission style.
<p> <a href="chilab.gif"><img align=left src="chilabtn.gif" width="98" height="144"></a> 
  This movement, which challenged the tastes of the Victorian era, was inspired 
  by the social reform concerns of thinkers such as Walter Crane and 
<a href=" http://www.visitcumbria.com/ruskin.htm">John 
  Ruskin</a>, together with the ideals of reformer and designer,
<a href="http://morris.artpassions.net/">William 
  Morris.  </a>

Their notions of good design were linked to their notions of 
  a good society. This was a vision of a society in which the worker was not brutalized 
  by the working conditions found in factories, but rather could take pride in 
  his craftsmanship and skill. The rise of a consumer class coincided with the 
  rise of manufactured consumer goods. In this period, manufactured goods were 
  often poor in design and quality. <a href="craft.gif"><img align=right src="crafttn.gif" width="193" height="126"> 
  </a> Ruskin, Morris, and others proposed that it would be better for all if 
  individual craftsmanship could be revived-- the worker could then produce beautiful 
  objects that exhibited the result of fine craftsmanship, as opposed to the shoddy 
  products of mass production. Thus the goal was to create design that was... 
  " for the people and by the people, and a source of pleasure to the maker and 
  the user." Workers could produce beautiful objects that would enhance the lives 
  of ordinary people, and at the same time provide decent employment for the craftsman. 
<p> <a href="jones.gif"><img align=left src="jonestn.gif" width="96" height="144"></a> 
  Medieval Guilds provided a model for the ideal craft production system. Aesthetic 
  ideas were also borrowed from Medieval European and Islamic sources. Japanese 
  ideas were also incorporated early Arts and Crafts forms. The
<a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style09a/objects/objects_home.html"> 
  forms of Arts and Crafts style </a> were typically rectilinear and angular, 
  with stylized decorative motifs remeniscent of medieval and Islamic design. 
  In addition to <a href=" http://www.burrows.com/morris.html ">William Morris, 
  </a> <a href=" http://www.burrows.com/voysey.html ">Charles Voysey </a> was 
  another important innovator in this style. One designer of this period, Owen 
  Jones, published a book entitled
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=V-ExGuD_Q28C&pg=PT102&lpg=PT102&dq=owen+jones+the+grammar+of+ornament&source=web&ots=dmn9B74Hl3&sig=o91JIyi66VnD_ub_dwflhEtp9Og#PPT20,M1"> 
<i>The Grammar of Ornament</i></a>, which was a 
  sourcebook of historic decorative design elements, largely taken from medieval 
  and Islamic sources. This work in turn inspired the use of such historic sources 
  by other designers.

  However,in time the English Arts and Crafts movement came to stress craftsmanship 
  at the expense of mass market pricing. The result was exquisitely made and decorated 
  pieces that could only be afforded by the very wealthy. Thus the idea of art 
  <i>for</i> the people was lost, and only relatively few craftsman could be employed 
  making these fine pieces. This evolved English Arts and Crafts style came to 
  be known as <strong>"Aesthetic Style."</strong> It shared some characteristics 
  with the French/Belgian Art Nouveau movement, to be discussed below.

However<a href=" http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Orchard/8642/#00"> in the United States, the Arts and Crafts ideal </a> of design for the
masses was more fully realized, though at the expense of the fine
individualized craftsmanship typical of the English style.  In New York,
 <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Stickley"> Gustav
Stickley </a> was trying to serve a burgeoning market of middle class consumers who
wanted affordable, decent looking furniture. By using factory methods to
produce basic components, and utilizing craftsmen to finish and assemble, he
was able to produce sturdy, serviceable furniture which was sold in vast
quantities, and still survives. The rectilinear, simpler
<a href=" http://www.arts-crafts.com/archive/rsimages.shtml"> 
American Arts and Crafts forms </a> came to dominate American architecture, interiors, 
and furnishings in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.
<p> <a href="stkley.gif"><img align=left src="stkleytn.gif" width="197" height="126"></a>
 
  Today Stickley's furniture is prized by collectors, and the
 <a href="http://www.stickley.com/"> 
  Stickley Company </a>
  still exists, producing reproductions of the original Stickley designs.

  The term <strong>Mission style</strong> was also used to describe Arts and Crafts 
  Furniture and design in the United States. The use of this term reflects the 
  influence of traditional furnishings and interiors from the American Southwest, 
  which had many features in common with the earlier British Arts and Crafts forms. 
  <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~bosley/exhibits.html">Charles and Henry Greene 
  </a> were important Mission style architects working in California. Southwestern 
  style also incorporated Hispanic elements associated with the early Mission 
  and Spanish architecture, and Native American design. The result was a blending 
  of the arts and crafts rectilinear forms with traditional Spanish colonial architecture 
  and furnishings. Mission Style interiors were often embellished with Native 
  American patterns, or actual Southwestern Native American artifacts such as 
  rugs, pottery, and baskets. The collecting of Southwestern artifacts became 
  very popular in the first quarter of the twentieth century.

This style, which was more or less concurrent with the Arts and Crafts style, 
was not at all concerned with the social reform movements of the day. Instead, 
it addressed the clutter and eclecticism of mid-19th century European taste. Originating 
in Belgium and France, this movement advocated nature as the true source of all 
good design. Art Nouveau designers objected to the borrowing of design ideas from 
the past, and even from other cultures, although the Japanese approach to nature 
was much admired and emulated. 
<p><br>
  <a href="vase.gif"><img align=right src="vasetn.gif" width="99" height="144"></a> 
  The characteristics of the style included above all the use of the sinuous curved 
  line, together with asymmetrical arrangement of forms and patterns. The forms 
  from nature most popular with Art Nouveau designers were characterized by flowing 
  curves-- grasses, lilies, vines, and the like. Other, more unusual natural forms 
  were also used, such as peacock feathers, butterflies, and insects.
