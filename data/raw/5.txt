</A></FONT></CENTER>

<P>

. . . any proposed solutions to the problems of world poverty, 

environmental destruction and social alienation will fail, 

unless they also address the role that the consumerist lifestyle plays 

in creating these problems.

<P>

. . . in a world of limited resources, a system that advocates an ever-increasing level of consumption, and equates such consumption 

with personal well-being, economic progress and social fulfilment, is a 

recipe for ecological disaster.

<P>

. . . if we in the wealthy nations want to see a just, stable and sustainable 

world, we are going to have to confront the issue of how unfairly it's resources 

are distributed in favour of a wealthy minority

<P>

. . . it is a myth to insist that rejecting consumerism also means rejecting 

our basic needs, our  technology, our stylishness, or our quality of life.

<P>

<BR>development and a higher
