   survivors of psychiatric incarceration (commonly known as &quot;mental


    patients&quot;) scholars and other concerned citizens.</FONT></FONT>

   <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="4">OUR POSITION 


   IS UNCOMPROMISING. WE BELIEVE THE &quot;MENTAL HEALTH&quot; 


   ESTABLISHMENT HAS CONNED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.</FONT></FONT>


  </P>


  <P>


   <FONT SIZE="3">The idea of &quot;mental illness&quot; is a misleading 


   and degrading metaphor. &quot;Psychiatric treatments&quot; in mental 


   hospitals are for the most part forms of physical and emotional 


   abuse. Psychiatric &quot;diagnoses&quot; are demeaning labels without 


   any scientific validity. The psychiatric Establishment is pushing 


   dangerous drugs which they euphemistically call 


   &quot;medication.&quot; Treatments in this century have ranged from 


   revolving chairs to lobotomies to electrical assaults on the human 


   brain to neurologically damaging drugs. There has been no revolution 


   in the treatment of individuals who are psychiatrically labeled: it 


   is an unbroken history of barbaric practices, justified by 


   professionals as medical procedures designed to control patients' 


   ostensible mental diseases.</FONT>

  <P>


   <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="4">THE STRUCTURE 


   OF DEMOCRACY IS BEING UNDERMINED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM</FONT></FONT>


  </P>


  <P>


   <FONT SIZE="3">The Network is emerging at an historical juncture that 


   constitutes a time of potential danger as well as opportunity. The 


   danger lies in the continued expansion of psychiatric power and of 


   the merger of the &quot;mental health&quot; system with the American 


   government. This forbodes a social control apparatus as totalitarian 


   as that forseen by George Orwell in </FONT><I><B><FONT SIZE="3">1984</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="3">.


    </FONT></I><FONT SIZE="3">In this case conformity to social norms 


   would be enforced by mental health professionals playing the role of 


   Big Brother. The opportunity lies in the possible development of a 


   social movement against the mental health system.</FONT>


  </P>


  <P>


   <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="4">FOR WELL OVER 


   THIRTY YEARS THEORISTS AND THERAPISTS HAVE BEEN WRITING DEVASTATING 


   CRITIQUES OF THE MEDICAL MODEL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR</FONT></FONT>


  </P>


  <P>


   <FONT SIZE="3">Thomas Szasz M.D. was the first to argue that to 


   describe individuals who are having &quot;problems in life&quot; as 


   mentally ill is to use a metaphor that is misleading and demeaning. 


   It obscures the individuals real problems and it serves to justify 


   psychiatric coercion and the gratuitous deprivation of individual 


   liberty. R.D. Laing, the British psychiatrist, argued that 


   &quot;psychiatric treatment&quot; of &quot;schizophrenia&quot; 


   typically aborts what is essentially a natural process tending toward 


   the reconstitution of the self on a more mature level.</FONT>


  </P>


  <P>


   <FONT SIZE="3">Theodore Sarbin and James Mancuso conclude in their 


   exhaustive study that despite 80 years of popularity, the 


   &quot;disease model&quot; has failed to establish its value as either 


   an explanatory theory or a practical tool. Family therapists like Jay 


   Haley, Salvador Minuchin and the Mental Research Institute have 


   demonstrated the extraordinary success of an approach that is not 


   based on the metaphor of mental illness. These 


   theorists/practitioners have had virtually no effect on public policy.</FONT>


  </P>


  <P>


   <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="4">IF THE CRISIS 


   IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS TO BE RESOLVED THE &quot;DISEASE 


   MODEL&quot; MUST BE REPLACED</FONT></FONT>


  </P>


  <P>


   <FONT SIZE="3">Viable models must be based on a developmental 


   perspective. In the context of this perspective, psychological and 


   spiritual crises, despair, anxiety, unusual behavior, and emotional 


   ups and downs are not symptoms of chronic mental illnesses but 


   natural manifestations of processes of individual and social growth 


   and maturation. If this change in orientation is effected, the 


   helping profession will be able to help people: it will help 


   individuals overcome their addiction to psychiatric drugs that impair 


   their ability to think and create, it will help reintegrate 


   individuals into society by making available to them education and 


   job training, housing and jobs-- it will give them the vision of a 


   future worth struggling for.</FONT>


  </P>


  <P>


   <FONT SIZE="3">In the absence of this fundamental philosophical 


   change, mental health workers will continue to impede individuals' 


   reintegration into society by branding them &quot;mentally ill&quot; 


   and by withholding from them opportunities for social and spiritual 


   advancement. The disastrous and unseemly results of the stunting of 


   individual growth by the mental health system will continue to be 


   blamed on &quot;the tragedy of mental illness.&quot;</FONT>

  <P>


   <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="4">A MONSTROUS 


   ABUSE OF POWER IS OCCURRING RIGHT NOW</FONT></FONT>


  </P>


  <P>


   <FONT SIZE="3">The American public is aware through exposure to a 


   variety of documentary materials- including such realistic works of 


   the imagination as </FONT><I><FONT SIZE="3">One Flew Over the 


   Cuckoo's Nest </FONT></I><FONT SIZE="3">by Ken Kesey- that 


   &quot;mental health&quot; professionals in the public sector in 


   another era abused the authority vested in them. The public has not 


   confronted the fact- and the media has not exposed the fact- that the 


   same kind of monstrous abuse of power is occurring right now. If the 


   radical humanitarian changes advocated by the critics of the mental 


   health system are to be implemented, it will be because the American 


   people will begin to realize that they have been abused and mystified 


   by the mental health professions and because they will seize the 


   opportunity to assert their rights and to demand accountability from 


   those who claim to serve them.</FONT>

   BEING TORTURED, OPPRESSED AND DENIED OWNERSHIP OF THEIR LIVES</FONT></FONT>


  </P>


  <P>


   <FONT SIZE="3">Psychiatric survivors have been organizing for human 


   rights and against psychiatric oppression since the mid-1970's. 


   George Ebert, a psychiatric survivor, recently described the reason 


   for his twelve year involvement in the movement against psychiatric 


   oppression. &quot;As long as the psychiatric state remains, as long 


   as people are being tortured, oppressed, dehumanized, and denied 


   ownership of their lives, we who have survived are obligated to 


   struggle to break the silence.&quot; The Network Against Coercive 


   Psychiatry calls upon all socially conscious persons to join the movement.</FONT>

   <I><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Times New I2"><FONT SIZE="3">The problem 


   with psychiatric diagnoses is... that they are swung as semantic 


   blackjacks: cracking the subject's dignity and respectibility 


   destroys him just as effectively as cracking his skull. The 


   difference is that the man who wields a blackjack is recognized by 


   everyone as a thug, but one who wields a psychiatric diagnosis is not.&quot;</FONT></FONT></I>
