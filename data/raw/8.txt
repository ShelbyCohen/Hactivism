				<div class="entry">
					<p>The realized truth of modern history is crystal clear. Washington had no 
      business intervening in a quarrel between two no-count wanna be dictators 
      (Syngman Rhee and Kim il Sung) on the Korean peninsula in June 1950, and 
      surely has no business still stationing 29,000 American soldiers there 67 
      years latter.</p>
    <p>Yet owing to the institutionalized albatross of that mis-vectored history, 
      the world is now much closer to the brink of nuclear war than at any time 
      since the dark days of the early cold war. And the Donald has become just 
      the latest political tourist in the Oval Office to succumb to the Deep State&#8217;s 
      false, self-serving narrative about why the American imperium remains decamped 
      on the 38th parallel.</p>
    <p>For sure, it was never about the real estate. After 40 years of brutal 
      and predatory Japanese occupation, post-war Korea was an economic backwater 
      with the GDP of perhaps Cleveland, Ohio. It had been divided at the 38th 
      parallel by Truman and Stalin as an afterthought at Potsdam (July 1945). 
      Far from any intent to create separate nations on a peninsula that had been 
      ethnically and politically unified for centuries, the line only marked a 
      convenient staging grounds for the impending final attack on Japan that 
      Stalin had committed to aid.</p>
    <p>In fact, Washington&#8217;s suave original cold warrior, Dean Acheson, had described 
      the Potsdam demarcation as a mere &#8220;surveyors line&#8221;. But as US/Soviet tensions 
      heated up in the late 1940&#8217;s, the US occupation forces in the south encouraged 
      the puppet government they had established under ex-pat and Washington dandy, 
      Syngman Rhee, to cleanse the country of left-wing influences and prepare 
      to eventually rule the entire penninsula.</p>
    <p>As<a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2013/07/28/who-really-started-the-korean-war/"> 
      Justin Raimondo succinctly chronicled</a> this period:</p>


    <p><em><strong>&#8230;&#8230;.the Korean war started during the American occupation 
      of the South, and it was Rhee, with help from his American sponsors, who 
      initiated a series of attacks that well preceded the North Korean offensive 
      of 1950. From 1945-1948, American forces aided Rhee in a killing spree that 
      claimed tens of thousands of victims: the counterinsurgency campaign took 
      a high toll in Kwangju, and on the island of Cheju-do â€“ where as many as 
      60,000 people were murdered by Rheeâ€™s US-backed forces.</strong></em></p>

    
<p><em><strong>Rheeâ€™s army and national police were drawn from the ranks of those 
  who had collaborated with the Japanese occupation during World War II, and this 
  was the biggest factor that made civil war inevitable. That the US backed these 
  quislings guaranteed widespread support for the Communist forces led by Kim 
  IL Sung, and provoked the rebellion in the South that was the prelude to open 
  North-South hostilities. Rhee, for his part, was eager to draw in the United 
  States, and the North Koreans, for their part, were just as eager to invoke 
  the principle of &#8220;proletarian internationalism&#8221; to draw in the Chinese and the 
  Russians.</strong></em></p>

<p>The last underlined sentence tells the whole story. When hostilities broke 
      out between the two Korean sides in June 1950, Washington instantly transformed 
      it into a proxy war against the Soviet Union and its fledgling ally in China, 
      which had just fallen under Mao&#8217;s control the previous year. As Truman baldly 
      put it, he was not going to loose another country to the &#8220;reds&#8221;.</p>
    <p>What we know today, and what staunch non-interventionists like Senator 
      Robert Taft and Congressman Howard Buffett (R-Nebraska and Warren&#8217;s father) 
      knew even then, is that 1950s style communism could take care of its own 
      self-destruction. America only needed to militarily secure the homeland, 
      and then wait out the eventual demise of the wretched states that had temporarily 
      fallen victim to communist misrule.</p>
    <p>That is to say, a vastly different foreign policy would have emerged if 
      it had been rooted in an understanding of the inherent superiority of free 
      market capitalism and the inexorable certainty that centralized socialism 
      would fail. Such a policy would never have been duped into the folly of 
      a proxy war on this economically and strategically irrelevant Asian littoral.</p>
    <p>As it happened, the Soviet Union did destroy itself from within in a matter 
      of decades. And just in the nick of time, Mr. Deng discovered that Mao had 
      nearly destroyed China on the false belief that it could be collectivized 
      from the barrel of a gun.</p>
    <p>Instead, Deng not only rescued Mao&#8217;s calamity by turning from firing squads 
      to a hyperactive printing press, but spawned the greatest Ponzi scheme of 
      borrowing, building, speculation and malinvestment in human history. It 
      is surely a false and unsustainable prosperity, but for the moment it rings 
      out a great irony.</p>
    <p>Rather than a threat to America&#8217;s security, Mr. Deng&#8217;s great Red Ponzi 
      is considered by Wall Street to be the very engine of &#8220;growth&#8221; in the modern 
      world and the suzerains of Beijing the very model of unfailing prosperity 
      management and economic &#8220;stimulus&#8221; if, as and when needed.</p>
    
<p>That begs the question, of course, as to what would have happened when the 
  Chinese army poured across the Yalu River in November 1950 if it had not been 
  impeded by American GIs. Would it have made any difference in the grand scheme 
  of history if China had ended up with <strong>35</strong> rather than <em><strong>34</strong> 
  </em>provincial-level administrative units. That is, <b>23 provinces</b>,<em><strong> 
  4 municipalities</strong></em> (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing) and<strong> 
  8</strong> rather than <strong>7 </strong>autonomous and special administrative 
  regions. </p>
    
<p>Would that contrafactual outcome not have been a big &#8220;so what!&#8221; </p>
    
<p>After all, had Korea ended up as number eight among China&#8217;s &#8220;autonomous and 
  special&#8221; administrative units exactly why would that imperil the safety and 
  security of the citizens of Lincoln NE or Worchester MA any more today than 
  does the current Chinese rule over Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Ningxia, 
  Xinjiang or even Hong Kong and Macau?</p>
    <p>So if there would be no threat now, why then? Why ever?</p>
    
<p>The fact is, the seven decade confrontation on the 38th parallel is an <em><strong>artifact 
  of empire, not a necessity of homeland security.</strong></em> It is the handiwork 
  of a Warfare State served by a permanent political class that derives its power, 
  purpose and resources from the faithful pursuit and stewardship of an American 
  Imperium.</p>
    <p>Stated differently, American soldiers are provocatively stationed on the 
      38th parallel &#8211; where on the other side of the line they have kept 
      the Kim family tyranny in business for seven decades &#8211; because Imperial 
      Washington, like Rome, needs purportedly imperiled frontiers to justify 
      its rule and heavy draft of military and economic resources.</p>
    <p>As it happened, therefore, 36,500 American soldiers died in Korea not turning 
      back an existential threat to the homeland &#8211; or even in extending the 
      reach of democracy. As Justin Raimondo further reminds, that is a fairy 
      tale. The Korean War quickly descended into a bloody slog essentially to 
      protect the corrupt, authoritarian regime of Syngman Rhee &#8211; a tyranny 
      that even the Korean people soon rejected:</p>
 
    <p><em><strong>As for this guff about &#8220;democracy&#8221;: whatever the US was fighting 
      for, from 1950, when the war broke out, to 1953, when it ground to a halt, 
      democracy hardly described the American cause.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>We were fighting on behalf of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngman_Rhee">Syngman 
      Rhee</a>, the US-educated-and-sponsored dictator of South Korea, whose vibrancy 
      was demonstrated by the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-4234885.html">large-scale 
      slaughter</a> of his leftist political opponents. For 22 years, Rheeâ€™s word 
      was law, and many thousands of his political opponents were <a href="http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=ffdict0434&amp;DataType=WorldHistory&amp;WinType=Free">murdered</a>: 
      tens of thousands were jailed or driven into exile. Whatever measure of 
      liberality has reigned on the Korean peninsula was in spite of Washingtonâ€™s 
      efforts and <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/dod/usfk.htm">ongoing</a> 
      military presence. When the country finally rebelled against Rhee, and threw 
      him out in the so-called April Revolution of 1960, he was ferried to safety 
      in a <a href="http://adst.org/2013/04/the-fall-of-south-korean-strongman-syngman-rhee-april-26-1960/">CIA 
      helicopter</a> as crowds converged on the presidential palace.</strong></em></p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t academic history or a wistful excersize in &#8220;could have been, 
      should have been.&#8221; After 1960, there were numerous times that Washington 
      could have evacuated the peninsula, but one imperial project after another 
      prevented the return of the Korean peninsula to the Koreans to settle their 
      differences as they saw fit.</p>
    <p>In the 1960s and early 1970&#8217;s it was the folly of the Vietnam invasion 
      that kept the fear of falling &#8220;dominoes&#8221; alive in the Imperial City and 
      American forces bivouacked on the 38th parallel in order to keep the two 
      Koreas divided.</p>
    <p>Likewise, during the 1980s the giant and unnecessary Reagan defense build-up 
      was predicated on the myth of a globally resurgent &#8220;Evil Empire&#8221; in Moscow, 
      meaning that the South Korean frontier required military reinforcement, 
      not the rational course of abandonment.</p>
    <p>Indeed, we recall well that the predicate for the massive squandering of 
      resources in the Reagan build-up was that America needed the capacity to 
      fight tw0-and-one-half wars simultaneously &#8211; the &#8220;half&#8221; war part being 
      on the Korean peninsula.</p>
    <p>Yes, China had just been enfeebled by Mao&#8217;s famines and the madness of 
      the cultural revolution and the Soviet economy was lapsing into the entropic 
      decay of over-centralization and militarization. So the two-and-one-half 
      war fighters never did say who it was that would occupy the Korean peninsula 
      other than some variant of the Korean people.</p>
    <p>That is to say, we never once heard the claim that the vastly more prosperous, 
      populous and industrially and technologically advanced south could not hold 
      its own against the goose-steeping potemkin army of the north. To the contrary, 
      the &#8220;threat&#8221; was always a new version of a theoretical proxy war that had 
      no reason to happen, and didn&#8217;t really matter for America&#8217;s security, anyway.</p>
    <p>Then came the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 and Mr. Deng&#8217;s massive 
      shift to export-mercantilism a few years later to save China from an economic 
      and civil collapse that would have ended the rule of the communist party. 
      At that point, there was zero chance of a renewed proxy war.</p>
    <p>So surely that was the very time to bring 29,000 American servicemen and 
      women home, thereby enabling the former Hermit Kingdom to work-out a 21st 
      century arrangement for either the reunification of all Koreans or at least 
      their co-existence in autonomous zones of self-governance.</p>
    <p>But that didn&#8217;t happen, either. And the reason is not hard to resurrect 
      from the history of the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Bill and Hillary were far more intent on gaining a second term in the White 
      House than in carrying out the assigned mandate of their 1960s generation. 
      That is, to dismantle the American Empire and bring the possibility of general 
      peace to the world for the first time since August 1914.</p>
    <p>So they temporized, thereby precluding a readily available peace settlement 
      in Korea &#8211; the better to keep unreconstructed GOP hawks and newly ascendant 
      neocons at bay.</p>
    <p>After that chance was blown, the South Koreans themselves attempted to 
      normalize the peninsula and pave the way for an end to the American occupation. 
      Between 1998 and 2006 they diligently pursued what they called the &#8220;sunshine 
      policy&#8221;. And it did begin to thaw the tensions between north and south for 
      the first time in 50 years &#8211; including humanitarian aid from the south, 
      family reunifications and the beginnings of cross-DMZ flows of trade and 
      investment.</p>
    <p>At length, the policy failed, but there should be no confusion as to why. 
      The blood-thirsty neocons of the George W. Bush administration killed it 
      in the cradle by naming North Korea to the axis of evil, when, in fact, 
      it was an accident of history long passed its sell-by date.</p>
    <p>Rarely has there be a stupider act of foreign policy than the hideous refrain 
      inserted into Bush&#8217;s 2002 State of the Union address by a speechwriter twit 
      named David Frum, who apparently invented the &#8220;axis of evil&#8221; from wholecloth. 
      That the Fat Boy ended up as an impetuous, bellicose rogue on the Kim throne 
      in 2011 is as much the responsibility of Frum and his fellow neocon belligerents 
      than anything else.</p>
    <p>Still, after all those blown chances to roll-back what is really an illicit 
      forward frontier of Imperial Washington, there is still no reason for any 
      American presence at all on the Korean peninsula. And that&#8217;s to say nothing 
      of the massive 350,000 soldier war game rehearsal for an invasion of North 
      Korea just completed by US and South Korean forces, as they do annually; 
      or all of the huffing and puffing during the past week from the White House 
      about the vastly exaggerated Korean nuclear threat.</p>
    <p>Indeed, on the question as to why Washington still has more than <em><strong>25,000 
      troops</strong> </em>in South Korea, we would add another.</p>
    <p>To wit, why does the US maintain a vast armada of warships, bases and military 
      occupations throughout East Asia 72 years after Japanese empire was reduced 
      to rubble and cinders; and also after the cold war disappeared into the 
      dustbin of history a quarter century ago and after the red suzerains of 
      Beijing hostaged their continued rule (and perhaps physical survival) to 
      the daily flow of $2 billion of exports to America&#8217;s ports.</p>

    <p>As to the peninsula itself, here is the latest information. The GDP of 
      North Korea is <em><strong>$17 billion</strong> </em>and that of South Korea 
      is <em><strong>$1.38 trillion</strong></em>. So the economy of the latter 
      happens to be <em><strong>81X bigger</strong> </em>than the GDP of the former.</p>
    <p>Likewise, the South Korea&#8217;s population of <em><strong>50 </strong></em>million 
      is <em><strong>2X larger</strong> </em>than the North&#8217;s <em><strong>25</strong></em> 
      million. And that&#8217;s to say nothing as to South Korea&#8217;s advanced technology, 
      millions of skilled industrial and tech workers and absence of the abject 
      poverty and even starvation which is rampant on the northern side of the 
      DMZ.</p>
    <p>So how is it that a nation that has been growing by leaps and bounds for 
      a half-century cannot defend itself from a two-bit industrial backwater 
      run by a certifiable lunatic? Why is it that no one in Washington has bothered 
      to notice that since 2002 South Korea&#8217;s economy has grown<em><strong> every 
      four months</strong> </em>by more than the entire current GDP of North Korea?</p>
    <p><img id="ImageChart" src="http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/south-korea-gdp.png?s=wgdpkore&amp;v=201701041319r&amp;d1=19170101&amp;d2=20171231&amp;type=column" srcset="http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/south-korea-gdp.png?s=wgdpkore&amp;v=201701041319r&amp;d1=19170101&amp;d2=20171231&amp;type=column 1x, http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/south-korea-gdp@2x.png?s=wgdpkore&amp;v=201701041319r&amp;d1=19170101&amp;d2=20171231&amp;type=column 2x, http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/south-korea-gdp@3x.png?s=wgdpkore&amp;v=201701041319r&amp;d1=19170101&amp;d2=20171231&amp;type=column 3x, http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/south-korea-gdp@4x.png?s=wgdpkore&amp;v=201701041319r&amp;d1=19170101&amp;d2=20171231&amp;type=column 4x" alt="South Korea GDP" /></p>
    <p>The argument for the huge US presence in South Korea, of course, is that 
      it provides a trip-wire deterrent that puts the North Korean ruler on notice 
      that an attack on South Korea is an attack on Washington. But with respect 
      to a potential conventional attack, that&#8217;s just plain malarkey.</p>
    <p>If South Korea with <strong>81X the economy</strong>, twice the population 
      and infinitely more industrial base and technological sophistication can&#8217;t 
      or won&#8217;t defend itself from the &#8220;potemkin&#8221; economy and military north of 
      its border, why should the American taxpayers and soldiers be called into 
      the breach?</p>
    <p>And &#8220;potemkin&#8221; is the right word for it. Most of North Korea&#8217;s military 
      equipment is 40 years old and is more suited to internal repression of uprisings, 
      not offensive action against the South. Thus, one of the few new aircraft 
      it has purchased since the 1980s is the Russian Su-25 Frogfoot, which is 
      a ground-attack aircraft similar to the American A-10.</p>
    <p>Needless to say, South Korea&#8217;s modern F-5, F-15 and F-16 fighters would 
      turn the slow and heavy Frogfoots into an exercise in shooting fish in a 
      barrel. Then again, the real job of the Frogfoots is not to attack South 
      Korea anyway; but they are just the thing to put down a coup by other North 
      Korean forces.</p>
    <p>Likewise, the 1,000,000 soldiers in the Korean People&#8217;s Army spend more 
      time as <em><strong>conscript construction labor</strong></em> and get far 
      more practice with shovels than Kalashnikov assault rifles; some of them 
      are also quite skilled at goose-stepping parade entertainment for the country&#8217;s 
      otherwise catatonic masses, as we saw this past weekend once again.</p>
    <p>Yes, Kim Jong Un allegedly likes to play with nukes, but even this whack 
      job must recognize he has a small problem. Namely, North Korea has tested 
      underground five tiny nuclear bombs so far (2006, 2009, 2013 and two in 
      2016). Yet none of them appear to have been even a &#8220;boosted&#8221; fission bomb, 
      let alone a thermonuclear (fusion) warhead.</p>
    <p>Indeed, the range of estimates put the latest explosion in September 2016 
      at about <em><strong>10 kilotons</strong> </em>or slightly smaller in size 
      than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945, code-named &#8220;Little Boy&#8221;.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2017/04/15/NK%20rockets%203.jpg"><img src="http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2017/04/15/NK%20rockets%203_0.jpg" width="500" height="188" /></a></p>
    <p>Needless to say, Little Boy was not delivered by a sea-based or land-based 
      intercontinental ballistic missile, and not just because neither had yet 
      been invented!</p>
    <p>In fact, it was dropped from bay of Enola Gay, a B-29 bomber, because, 
      as is self-evident from the photo of Little Boy below, it was just an A-bomb, 
      not an H-bomb. It was therefore way too big and bulky to fit in the nosecone 
      of a missile, even if the US had possessed one.</p>
    <p>That is, to miniaturize a nuke sufficiently to get its weight and size 
      down to missile-riding scale, it needs to be a thermonuclear device.</p>
    <p><a class="image" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Little_boy.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Little_boy.jpg/450px-Little_boy.jpg" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Little_boy.jpg/450px-Little_boy.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Little_boy.jpg/600px-Little_boy.jpg 2x" alt="Little boy.jpg" width="300" height="197" data-file-height="462" data-file-width="703" /></a></p>
    <p><em><strong>Here&#8217;s the thing. The Fat Boy of Pyongyang doesn&#8217;t have one; 
      he&#8217;s still at the Little Boy stage.</strong></em></p>
    <p>In fact, what he has tested so far would have to be delivered by one of 
      his 50-year old Soviet era Il-28/H-5 bombers, which amble in the sky at 
      slow speeds and low altitudes and would be shot down by South Korean fighters 
      or air defenses in a heartbeat. That is to say, at the moment the only thing 
      the Fat Boy can actually vaporize is his own country.</p>
    <p>There&#8217;s that, and with respect to the CNN War Channel hyperventilating 
      about a putative nuke attack on California, there is the further fact that 
      the Fat Boy is not remotely close to having a long-range intercontinental 
      missile that could deliver a thermonuclear warhead, if he had one.</p>
    <p>So far, North Korea has developed and <em><strong>tested</strong></em> 
      three longer range missiles including Taepodong-1, which has an estimated 
      maximum range of about 1,500 miles; and Musudan and Taepodong-2, which have 
      estimated maximum ranges of 2,000 miles and 3,500 miles, respectively, none 
      of which get you to the Left Coast.</p>
    <p>Moreover, Taepodong-1 has had just one known test flight. Way back in April 
      1998, a modified space-launch configuration of the vehicle lifted off with 
      a small satellite onboard; the launch failed.</p>
    <p>The Taepodong-2 failed during a 2006 test flight, its only known liftoff. 
      Later, North Korea <em><strong>modified</strong></em> that missile into 
      the Unha space launcher, which lofted satellites to orbit in December 2012 
      and February 2016, but it is not longer even in military service.</p>
    <p>The Musudan has seen a lot more test action. North Korea apparently tested 
      the medium-range missile seven times last year, and all except one blew-up 
      at launch, as did the Sunday launch, or within a few hundred kilometers 
      of flight.</p>
    <p>Yes, if you set a thousand monkeys at typewriters long enough, they will 
      supposedly type the New Testament. But at this stage of the game there is 
      no urgency whatsoever about any danger to the homeland, or even Japan or 
      South Korea from a preemptive nuclear attack by Fat Boy.</p>
    <p>So instead of &#8216;running out of patience&#8221; as the Trump Administration has 
      proclaimed, now would be the time to do the opposite. That is, recognize 
      that the Empire&#8217;s frontier on the 38th parallel has been a needless provocation 
      for 67 years, and that it is still not too late to abandon these pointless 
      outposts.</p>
    <p>Indeed, if the Chinese are to take the lead in denuclearizing and politically 
      normalizing the peninsula, getting American forces and weaponry out of there 
      is the essential first step.</p>
    <p>In fact, South Korea is about to elect a new government under Moon Jae-in, 
      the Democratic Party nominee. Moon has said he would review the previous 
      South Korean governmentâ€™s decision to host the American THAAD missile defense 
      system and would seek a meeting with North Koreaâ€™s Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang 
      as a priority over going to Washington.</p>
    <p>That is, with the distinct possibility of South Korean politics shifting 
      back to a Sunshine Policy, why should anyone be surprised that the Deep 
      State is suddenly beating the war drums about a false, imminent threat of 
      a nuclear attack by North Korea?</p>
    <p>The irony is that the Donald should understand this better than most. After 
      all, it amounts to a blatant attempt by Imperial Washington to &#8220;meddle&#8221; 
      in the upcoming South Korean election!</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the Donald is surrounded by generals and national security 
      apparatchiks who have spent a lifetime defending the frontiers of the American 
      Empire, and are not about to see the light now. So yet another chance for 
      peace is being turned into an opportunity for imperial aggrandizement.</p>
    <p>Still, even if US national security did require giving South Korea a shield 
      of nuclear deterrence, which it doesn&#8217;t, that still does not necessitate 
      the 28,500 US military personal stationed there &#8211; to say nothing of 
      the vast US armada on the Pacific rim described above.</p>
    <p><em><strong>The fact is, North Korea could be turned into a parking lot 
      by the payload of a single Trident nuclear submarine lurking safely out 
      of harm&#8217;s way in the deep Pacific.</strong></em></p>
    <p>To wit, each of the Trident&#8217;s W88 warheads yield about <em><strong>475 
      kilotons of destructive power or about 30 times the</strong></em><em> </em><strong>yield</strong> 
      of the latest North Korean test.</p>
    <p>But here&#8217;s another thing. Even after accounting for current treaty restrictions, 
      one Trident submarine can carry <em><strong>20 missiles</strong> </em>with 
      <em><strong>8 warheads</strong> </em>on each missile. That means just one 
      of the Navy&#8217;s 14 Trident submarines can deliver <em><strong>76,000 kilotons</strong> 
      (160 warheads X 475Kt each) </em>of nuclear payload.</p>
    <p>That&#8217;s <em><strong>4,000 times</strong> </em>more than &#8220;Little Boy&#8221; delivered 
      to Hiroshima in August 1945. And it&#8217;s also <em><strong>4,000</strong> </em><strong>times</strong> 
      more than Fat Boy can deliver by slow bomber today!</p>
    <p>In short, if the job is actually deterring Kim Jong Un&#8217;s nuclear fantasies, 
      the whole matter could be handled by permitting the South Koreans to rent 
      the services of one Trident submarine. And that could be done for far less 
      than the $1 billion per year they are now paying to help defray the massive 
      cost of the 29,000 US troops stationed there and the huge infrastructure 
      required to support them in combat ready modalities.</p>
    <p>The case of the lonely Trident sub lurking deep in the vast Pacific, of 
      course, raises an even bigger question. Why in the world is there still 
      <em><strong>54,000 troops</strong> </em>and <em><strong>50,000 </strong></em>more 
      dependents and civilian contractor personnel in Okinawa and Japan spread 
      among 85 different military and other facilities &#8211; since these &#8220;hostages&#8221; 
      to the whims of Kim Jong Un are also offered up as reasons for provoking 
      a nuclear showdown on the Korean peninsula?</p>
    <p>After all, the Japanese did agree to unconditional surrender after two 
      of their cites were fried alive in August 1945. Hardly an ill-word has been 
      spoken against America in the Japanese Diet or halls of government since.</p>
    <p>So when it comes to the question as to why the American Imperium is still 
      implanted from Singapore to Okinawa and the Japanese Islands and why the 
      Seventh Fleet &#8211; and its 80 ships, 150 aircraft and 40,000 sailors &#8211; 
      continuously and massively patrols the blue waters surrounding the eastern 
      shores of the Asian continent, all roads led to an even more preposterous 
      reality.</p>
    <p>To wit, Washington is apparently protecting East Asia from the Red Suzerains 
      of Beijing, who the Donald is now imploring to help reel in the Fat Boy 
      of Pyongyang!</p>
    <p>Yes, the pursuit of empire weaves a wretched plot, as it has on the Korean 
      littoral for 67 years running.<b></b></p>

<p>Glassing North Korea would have unfortunate effects on the U.S. West Coast.</p>
<p>Pollution from around China easily crosses the Pacific in five days to California, riding the jet stream. If its too fine to wash out in rain or snow, it prevents precipitation by collecting moisture but remaining in suspension as clouds. The U.S. gets everything from lead to ozone to sulfate, with Chinese sulfate pollution alone contributing to a quarter of sulfate pollution in the U.S. (Reuters, Jan 21, 2014, &#8220;China Pollution is Hitting America&#8217;s West Coast&#8221;)</p>
<p>Japan&#8217;s Fukushima reactor disasters, as contained as they were, also sent airborne radioactive isotopes in small amounts across the U.S..</p>
<p>A nuke blast in anger would kick up a fair quantity of fallout globally, perhaps even if it were a bunker busting nuke. War in Korea won&#8217;t be environmentally friendly in the least even if the effect over here are not nearly as immediately fatal.</p>

I think they&#8217;re coming to realize Kim Jung-Un doesn&#8217;t scare easily and might not back down at all.

<p>I think it&#8217;s hoping China can step in &#8211; actually, save its butt &#8211; and we may see the US fleet sail off somewhere with warnings about good behavior etc. But if that happens the whole world will know China saved America.</p>
