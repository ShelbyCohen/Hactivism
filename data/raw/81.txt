Russian Empire
</a>
–
One of the largest empires in history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. It expanded to the west and south. Its German-descended cadet branch, the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov, ruled from 1762. With million subjects registered by the 1897 census, it had the third-largest population in the world at the time, after Qing China and India. Like all empires, it included a large disparity in terms of economics, religion. There were dissident elements, who launched numerous rebellions and assassination attempts; they were closely watched by the secret police, with thousands exiled to Siberia. Economically, the empire had a agricultural base, with low productivity on large estates worked by serfs. The economy slowly industrialized in railways and factories. The land was ruled through the 17th centuries, subsequently by an emperor. Tsar Ivan III laid the groundwork for the empire that later emerged. He tripled the territory of his state, ended the dominance of the Golden Horde, laid the foundations of the Russian state. The Great fought numerous wars and expanded an already huge empire into a major European power. Catherine the Great presided over a golden age. She expanded the state by conquest, diplomacy, continuing Peter the Great's policy of modernisation along West European lines. Tsar Alexander II promoted numerous reforms, most dramatically the emancipation of all million serfs in 1861.

Russian Empire
–
Peter the Great officially renamed the Tsardom of Russia the Russian Empire in 1721, and himself its first emperor. He instituted the sweeping reforms and oversaw the transformation of Russia into a major European power.

–
The RSDLP was a political party formed in Minsk to unite the various revolutionary organisations of the Russian Empire into one party. In the Second Party Congress vote, the Bolsheviks won on the majority of important issues, hence their name. They ultimately became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Their beliefs and practices were often referred to as Bolshevism. Lenin wanted members &quot;who recognise the Party Programme and support it by material means and by personal participation in one of the party's organisations.&quot; Julius Martov suggested &quot;by regular personal assistance under the direction of one of the party's organisations.&quot; A main source of the factions could be directly attributed to Lenin’s steadfast opinion and unwillingness to &quot;bear opinions which were contrary to his own&quot;. It was the loyalty that he had to his own self-envisioned utopia that caused the party split. One of Lenin's fellow revolutionaries, compared Lenin to the revolutionary Robespierre. The root of the split was a book titled What is to be Done? that Lenin wrote while serving a sentence of exile. In Germany, the book was published in 1902; in Russia, strict censorship outlawed its publication and distribution. One of the main points of Lenin’s writing was that a revolution can only be achieved by the strong leadership of one person over the masses. After the proposed revolution had successfully overthrown the government, this individual leader must release power, to allow socialism to fully encompass the nation. Lenin also wrote that revolutionary leaders must dedicate their entire lives to the cause in order for it to be successful. Lenin's view of a socialist intelligentsia showed that he was not a complete supporter of Marxist theory, which also created some party unrest.

Nation state
</a>
–
A state is specifically a geopolitical entity, whilst a nation is a cultural and ethnic one. &quot;Nation state&quot; formation can take place at different times in different parts of the world. The key distinction is the identification of a people with a polity in the &quot;state.&quot; The origins and early history of nation states are disputed. A major theoretical question is: &quot;Which came first, the nation or the nation state?&quot; It was with technological advances that the nation state arose. For others, the nation state was created to meet that demand. Some &quot;modernization theories&quot; of nationalism see it as a product of government policies to modernize an already existing state. Most theories see the state as a 19th-century European phenomenon, facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education, mass literacy and mass media. However, historians also note the early emergence of a relatively unified identity in Portugal and the Dutch Republic. In France, Eric Hobsbawm argues, the French state preceded the formation of the French people. At the time of the 1789 French Revolution, 12-13 % spoke it &quot;correctly&quot;, according to Hobsbawm. During the Italian unification, the number of people speaking the Italian language was even lower. The French state promoted the unification of various languages into the French language. The introduction of conscription and the Third Republic's 1880s laws on public instruction, facilitated the creation of a national identity, under this theory.

October Revolution
</a>
–
It took place with an armed insurrection in Petrograd traditionally dated to 25 October 1917. During this time, urban workers began to organize into councils wherein revolutionaries criticized its actions. The October Revolution in Petrograd gave the power to the local soviets. The Bolshevik party was heavily supported by the soviets. This immediately initiated the establishment of the world's first self-proclaimed socialist state. The revolution was led by the Bolsheviks, who used their influence in the Petrograd Soviet to organize the armed forces. Bolshevik Red Guards forces under the Military Revolutionary Committee began the takeover of government buildings on 24 October 1917. The Winter Palace, was captured. The long-awaited Constituent Assembly elections were held on 12 November 1917. The Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715 seat legislative body, coming in second behind the Socialist Revolutionary party, which won 370 seats. Its convocation was delayed until 5 January 1918 by the Bolsheviks. As the revolution was not universally recognized, there followed the creation of the Soviet Union in 1922. At first, the event was referred to as the Uprising of 25th, as seen in contemporary documents. In Russian, however, &quot;переворот&quot; has a similar meaning to &quot;revolution&quot; and also means &quot;upheaval&quot; or &quot;overturn&quot;, so &quot;coup&quot; is not necessarily the correct translation. With time, the term October Revolution came into use.

The Allies of World War I were the countries that opposed the Central Powers in the First World War. The members of the original Entente Alliance of 1907 were the Russian Empire. Japan was another important member. Belgium, Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, Romania were affiliated members of the Entente. The 1920 Treaty of Sèvres defines the Principal Allied Powers as the British Empire, French Republic, Italy and Japan. The Allied Powers comprised, together with the Principal Allied Powers, Czechoslovakia. It declared war on Austria-Hungary in December 1917. Although the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria severed relations with the United States, neither declared war. The Dominion governments did control recruiting, removed personnel from front-line duties as they saw fit. From early 1917, the War Cabinet was superseded by the Imperial War Cabinet, which had Dominion representation. In April 1918, operational control of all Entente forces on the Western Front passed to the new supreme commander, Ferdinand Foch of France. The Austrian Empire followed with an attack on the Serbian ally Montenegro on 8 August. On the Western Front, the two neutral States of Belgium and Luxembourg were immediately occupied by German troops as part of the German Schlieffen Plan. On 23 August Japan joined the Entente, which then counted seven members.. The entrance of the British Empire brought Nepal into the war.

White Movement
</a>
–
Continuations of the movement, some of which only had narrow support, endured within the wider White émigré community until after the fall of Communism. The Whites had the stated aim of fighting against traitors, barbarians, murderers. They worked to remove Soviet functionaries in White-controlled territory. Overall, the White Army was nationalistic, rejected ethnic separatism. The White Army generally believed in opposed separatists who wanted to create nation-states instead of the Tsarist Russian Empire. Amongst White Army members, anti-Semitism was widespread. Western sponsors appeared more progressive. Many of the White leaders were conservative, accepting autocracy while remaining suspicious of &quot;politics&quot;. Aside from being patriotic, the Whites had no set ideology or main leader. The movement had no plan for foreign policy; Whites differed on policies toward Germany, debating whether or not to ally with it. White-movement leaders such as Anton Denikin advocated for Russians to create their own government, claiming the military could not decide in Russians' steads. Some warlords who were aligned with the White movement, such as Roman Ungern von Sternberg, did not acknowledge any authority but their own. Consequently, the White movement had no set political leanings: members could be monarchists, republicans, rightists, etc.. Moreover, political parties supported the anti-Bolshevik White Army, among them the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, others who opposed Lenin's Bolshevik October Revolution of 1917. But depending on the place, those White Army supporters might also exchange right-wing allegiance for allegiance to the Red Army.

Finland, officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is million, staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. Finland is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in the capital Helsinki, an autonomous region, the Åland Islands. Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area, which produces a third of the country's GDP. From the 12th century, Finland was an integral part of Sweden, a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and its official status. Nevertheless, in 1809, Finland was incorporated into the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, Finland declared itself independent. After a brief attempt to establish a kingdom, the country became a republic. Finland established an official policy of neutrality. The Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948 gave some leverage in Finnish domestic politics during the Cold War era. Finland was a relative latecomer to industrialization, remaining a largely agrarian country until the 1950s.

Finnish Civil War
</a>
–
The Finnish Civil War concerned leadership and control of Finland during the transition from a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire to an independent state. The conflict formed a part of the national, social turmoil caused by World War I in Europe. The war was fought between the Reds, conducted by the non-socialist, conservative-led senate. The paramilitary Red Guards, composed of agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centers of southern Finland. The paramilitary White Guards, composed of middle-class and upper-class factions, controlled rural central and northern Finland. Finnish society had experienced rapid population growth, industrialization, the rise of a comprehensive labor movement. The Reds carried out an general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. Both the Whites engaged in political terror. A large number of Reds perished due to disease in prison camps. Altogether, around 39,000 people died including 36,000 Finns - out of a population of 3,000,000. In the aftermath, the Finns passed to the German sphere of power. The Finnish conservatives tried to establish a Finnish monarchy, but the plan was aborted by the defeat of Germany in World War I. Finland emerged as an independent, democratic republic. The war remains one of the most emotionally charged events in Finnish history.

The term in Finnish historiography heimosodat has been translated literally into English as &quot;Kindred Nations Wars&quot;, &quot;Wars for kindred peoples&quot; or &quot;Kinship Wars,&quot; specifically Finnic kinship. It is sometimes erroneously translated as &quot;Tribal Wars&quot;. It refers to conflicts in territories inhabited by other Baltic Finnic peoples, often in borders of Russia. Many of the volunteer soldiers were inspired by the idea of Greater Finland. Estonian War of I Suomalainen Vapaajoukko helped Estonian troops. Finnic peoples were at a less organized level of cultural, economic and political capability. For the two next decades, Finns participated at a relatively high rate in nationalistic activities. This development was related to the divisiveness of the Civil War. Many of the White sympathizers in the Civil War became radically nationalistic as a result of the war. The strenuous five-year period 1939–45 of total war—which also mostly unified the nation—drained this excess of enthusiasm.

The Viena expedition was a military expedition in March 1918 by Finnish volunteer forces to annex White Karelia from Bolshevist Russia. It was one of the many &quot;kinship wars&quot; fought near the newly independent Finland during the Russian Civil War. However, many advocates of a Greater Finland considered these supported the annexation of Russian East Karelia to Finland. The expedition was made up of two groups. One group was Finnish Jäger troops led by Lieutenant Kurt Martti Wallenius. The Red Finns were forced to withdraw to Eastern Karelia. His light infantry crossed the border at Kuusamo but got bogged down in fighting the Finnish Red Guards. In the end the force was performed only small incursions into East Karelia. The other group was consisted of about 350 volunteers. By 10 Malm's group had advanced as far as the coastal town of Kem on the White Sea. Malm retreated to Uhtua where he began defending western White Sea Karelia. The Finns now adopted a village-by-village strategy of persuading locals to join the Finnish volunteer side. When the Finnish troops arrived in White Sea Karelia they noticed that the population was divided. A part of the population wanted to form an independent Karelia separate from Finland. However, a larger part of the population just wanted some form of autonomy.

The Aunus expedition was an attempt by Finnish volunteers to occupy parts of East Karelia in 1919, during the Russian Civil War. Aunus is the Finnish name for Olonets Karelia. Earlier attempts in 1918 to Petsamo and White Karelia had failed, partly due to a passive attitude of the Karelians. Later the British occupied White Karelia. During the summer of 1918, the government of Finland received various appeals for joining the area to Finland. Especially active were the inhabitants of the parish of Repola, which had held a vote to join Finland. The Finnish Army occupied the parish in the fall of 1918. In January 1919 a small expedition of volunteers was quickly repulsed by Bolshevik forces. Porajärvi held a vote on January 7 to also join Finland. During the same time the Jaeger-Major Gunnar von Herzen was chosen as the commander of the troops. He thought that the expedition would succeed with a thousand Finnish volunteers, but only if the Karelians would join the fighting. Mannerheim demanded that Britain would also have to approve of it before it would proceed. The expedition crossed the border on the night of April 1919. The goals were to capture Lodeynoye Pole, the Murmansk railroad. The troops were made up of 1000 volunteers.

Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk and Szczecin—the country's largest urban agglomeration is the Silesian Metropolis. This union formed the Polish -- Europe. The Commonwealth ceased to exist in the years 1772 -- 95, when its territory was partitioned among Prussia, Austria. Poland regained its independence in 1918. In September 1939, World War II started by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. More than million Polish citizens died in the war. The borders of Poland were shifted westwards according to the Potsdam Conference in the aftermath of World War II. Poland adopted a new constitution establishing itself as a democracy. Despite the large number of casualties and destruction the country experienced during World War II, the country managed to preserve much of its cultural wealth. There are 14 heritage sites inscribed on many objects of cultural heritage in Poland. Poland is a democratic country with an advanced high-income economy, a very high standard of living. Moreover, the country is visited by every year which makes it one of the most visited countries in the world. Poland is the eighth largest economy among the fastest growing European economies.

Second Polish Republic
</a>
–
Officially known as the Republic of Poland or the Commonwealth of Poland, the Polish state was recreated in 1918, in the aftermath of World War I. It had access to the Baltic Sea via a short strip of coastline either side of the city of Gdynia. Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-Hungarian governorate of Subcarpathia. The Second Republic was significantly different in territory to the current Polish state. It included substantially more territory in the east and less in the west. The Second Republic's land area was 388,634 km2, making it, in October 1938, the sixth largest country in Europe. After the annexation of Zaolzie, this grew to 389,720 km2. According to the 1921 census, the number of inhabitants was 27.2 million. By 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, this had grown to an estimated 35.1 million. Almost a third of population came from minority groups: 13.9% Ukrainians; 10% Jews; 3.1% Belarusians; 2.3% Germans and 3.4% Czechs, Lithuanians and Russians. At the same time, a significant number of ethnic Poles lived outside the country borders, many in the Soviet Union. Poland maintained a slow but steady level of economic development. By 1939, the Republic had become &quot;one of Europe's major powers&quot;. The victorious Allies of World War I confirmed the rebirth of Poland in the Treaty of Versailles of June 1919. It was one of the great stories of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference.

Polish-Ukrainian War
</a>
–
Eastern Galicia had the largest oil reserves in Europe. The origins of the conflict lie at the turn of the 20th century. After that, Ruthenian language schools were established, the Ruthenians began attempts to develop their national culture. In the first decades of the next century, the populist Ruthenian intelligentsia adopted the term Ukrainians to describe their nationality. Beginning with the 20th century, national consciousness reached a large number of Ruthenian peasants. Multiple incidents between the two nations occurred throughout early 20th century. In 1897 the Polish administration opposed the Ukrainians in parliamentary elections. In 1903 both Poles and Ukrainians held separate conferences in Lviv. Afterwards, the two national movements developed with contradictory goals, leading towards the later clash. The ethnic composition of Galicia underlay the conflict between the Poles and Ukrainians there. The Austrian province of Galicia consisted of territory seized from Poland during the first partition. In eastern Galicia, Ukrainians made up approximately 65% of the population while Poles made up only 22% of the population. In Lviv, the population in 1910 was 17 % Ukrainian. This city with its Polish inhabitants was considered by many Poles to have been one of Poland's cultural capitals. Including Lviv's Polish population, it was unthinkable that their city should not be under Polish control.

Polish-Soviet War
</a>
–
Ultimately the Soviets, following on from their Westward Offensive of 1918–19, hoped to fully occupy Poland. Lenin, meanwhile, saw Poland as the bridge the Red Army had to cross to bring about other European revolutions. By 1919, Polish forces had taken control of much of Western Ukraine, emerging victorious from the Polish -- War. The West Ukrainian People's Republic, led by Yevhen Petrushevych, had tried to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and Ukrainians laid claim. By the end of 1919, a clear front had formed as Petliura decided to ally with Piłsudski. Border skirmishes escalated following Piłsudski's Kiev Offensive in April 1920. The Polish offensive was met by an initially successful Red Army counterattack. The Soviet operation pushed the Polish forces back westward all the way to Warsaw, while the Directorate of Ukraine fled to Western Europe. Meanwhile, Western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers increased the interest of Western powers in the war. In the wake of the Polish advance eastward, the Soviets sued for the war ended with a ceasefire in October 1920. The Peace of Riga, was signed on 18 March 1921, dividing the disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. The war largely determined the Soviet–Polish border for the period between the World Wars. The war is known by several names. Alternative names include &quot;Russo–Polish War of 1919–1921&quot; and &quot;Polish–Bolshevik War&quot;. This second term is most common in Polish sources.

The Polish–Lithuanian War was an armed conflict between newly independent Lithuania and Poland in the aftermath of World War I. The conflict primarily concerned territorial control of the Vilnius Region, including the Suwałki Region, including the towns of Suwałki, Augustów, Sejny. There are major differences historiography regarding treatment of the war. According to Lithuanian historians, the war spanned from spring 1919 to November 1920. According to Poland, the war was part of the Polish -- Soviet War. In April 1919, Poland came in contact with the Lithuanian Army fighting in the Lithuanian -- Soviet War. Faced with the Polish -- Lithuanian relations were not immediately hostile. Poland hoped to persuade Lithuania to join some kind of Polish -- Lithuanian union, which Lithuania saw to Polish federalism. As bilateral relations worsened, the Entente drew two demarcation lines in hopes to stall open hostilities. The lines were ignored. When a Polish coup against the Lithuanian government failed in August 1919, the front stabilized until summer 1920. In July 1920, Poland was in full retreat. The Lithuanians followed retreating Polish troops to secure the territory, assigned by the Soviet -- Lithuanian Peace Treaty. The Soviets were the first to enter Vilnius. When Poland forced the Soviets to retreat in August 1920, Lithuanians defended their new borders.

Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of 603,628 km2, making the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. The territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC. Two brief periods of independence occurred during the 20th century, once near another during World War II. Following independence, Ukraine declared a neutral state. Nonetheless it formed a limited military partnership with NATO in 1994. In the 2000s, a deeper cooperation with the alliance was set by the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan signed in 2002. It was later agreed that the question of joining NATO should be answered at some point in the future. Former President Viktor Yanukovych was against Ukraine joining NATO. These events formed the background by Russia in March 2014, the War in Donbass in April 2014. Both are still ongoing as of December 2016. On 1 Ukraine applied the economic part of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the European Union. It remains one of the world's largest grain exporters. The diversified economy of Ukraine includes a heavy industry sector, particularly in aerospace and industrial equipment. Ukraine is a unitary republic under a semi-presidential system with separate powers: legislative, judicial branches.

Between April and December 1918 the Ukrainian People's Republic did not function, having been overthrown by the Ukrainian State of Pavlo Skoropadsky. By then the state de facto no longer existed. The 18 March 1921 Treaty of Riga between the Second Polish Republic, Soviet Ukraine sealed the fate of the Ukrainian People's Republic. The Soviet Union would extend control over what would ultimately become the Soviet Socialist Republic and a founding member of the Soviet Union. On June 1917 the Ukrainian Central Council declared its autonomy as part of the Russian Republic by its First Universal at the All-Ukrainian Military Congress. The highest governing body of the Ukrainian People's Republic became the General Secretariat headed by Volodymyr Vynnychenko. After the Tsentralna Rada threw its support behind the Bolsheviks, the Russian forces were eliminated from Kiev. After expelling the government forces, the Rada announced a wider autonomy for the Ukrainian Republic, still maintaining ties on November 22, 1917. It also stated the people of the governorates: Voronezh, Kholm, Kursk were welcome to join the republic through a referendum. The Central Rada expressed its hopes for the resolution of the chaos. After a brief truce, the Bolsheviks realized that the Rada had no intention of supporting the Bolshevik Revolution. They re-organized into an All-Ukrainian Council of Soviets in an attempt to seize power. When that failed due to the Bolsheviks' relative lack of popularity in Kiev, they moved to Kharkiv. The Bolshevik Red Army entered Ukraine in support of the local Soviet government. The Donetsk-Kryvoi Rog Republic was created by a direct decree of Lenin with its capital in Kharkiv.

The Carpathian Mountains, with their tallest peak Moldoveanu at 2,544 m, cross Romania from the north to the southwest. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence in 1877. At the end of World War I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the sovereign Kingdom of Romania. Romania lost several territories, of which Northern Transylvania was regained after the war. Following the war, Romania became a socialist member of the Warsaw Pact.

From the start, the eastern city of Kharkiv served as the republic's capital. However, in 1934, the seat of government was subsequently moved to the city of Kiev, which remained the capital of newly independent Ukraine. The Ukrainian SSR's border with Czechoslovakia formed the Soviet Union's western-most border point. According to the Soviet Census of 1989 the republic had a population of 51,706,746 inhabitants, which fell sharply after the breakup of the Soviet Union. The name &quot;Ukraine;&quot; derived from the Slavic word &quot;kraj&quot;, meaning &quot;land&quot; or &quot;border&quot;. It was first used to define part of the territory of Kievan Rus' in the 12th century. The name has been used in a variety of ways since the twelfth century. During a period of civil war from 1917-23 many factions claiming themselves governments of the newly born republic were formed, each with supporters and opponents. The two most prominent of them were the government in Kiev and the government in Kharkiv. The former being the Ukrainian People's Republic and the latter the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. This government of the Soviet Ukrainian Republic was founded on 24–25 December 1917. In its publications it names itself either the &quot;Republic of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers', Peasants' Deputies&quot; or the &quot;Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets.&quot; The last session of the government took place in the city of Taganrog. In July 1918 the former members of the government formed the Communist Party of Ukraine, the constituent assembly of which took place in Moscow. On 10 March 1919, according to the 3rd Congress of Soviets in Ukraine the name of the state was changed to the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic.

It was installed after the socialist-leaning Central Council of the Ukrainian People's Republic was dispersed on April 1918. Ukraine turned into a provisional dictatorship of Hetman of Ukraine Pavlo Skoropadskyi, who outlawed all political parties, creating an anti-Bolshevik front. The Ukrainian People's Republic returned to power in the form of the Directorate. Military support from the Central Powers saw some improved stabilization within the country. The country lay in Eastern Europe along the middle and lower sections of the Dnieper on the coast of Black and Azov Seas. The Ukrainian State covered most of the territory of modern-day Ukraine -- minus Crimea. Its territory however extended into today's Russia, Belarus, Moldova and Poland. To the southwest along the Dniester lay a border to the west Ukraine bordered the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. To the north were the German-occupied territories of Ober Ost and the Belarusian National Administration. The German Army Group Kiev was headed by the German Field Marshal Hermann von Eichhorn. Through that bank the occupational forces were officially conducting all financial operations with the Reichsbank in Berlin. After that all participants moved to St Sophia's Square, where Skoropadskyi was blessed by the Vicar of Kiev and Galicia. The Hetman supporters took over government building of military and internal affairs as well as the State Bank. The elite and most loyal formation of the Central Council, the Sich Riflemen, was disarmed. Skoropadskyi issued his manifesto &quot;To the Law of the Provisional State System.

West Ukrainian People's Republic
</a>

The West Ukrainian People's Republic was a short-lived republic that existed in late 1918 and early 1919 in eastern Galicia. It included the cities of Lviv, Przemyśl, Kolomyia and Stanislaviv and claimed parts of Bukovina and Carpathian Ruthenia. Politically, the Ukrainian National Democratic Party dominated the assembly, guided by varying degrees of socialist ideology. Other parties represented included the Ukrainian Radical Party and the Christian Social Party. The coat of arms of the West Ukrainian People's Republic was Azure, a lion rampant Or. The colours of the flag were blue and yellow. According to the Austro-Hungarian census of 1910, the territory claimed by the West Ukrainian People's Republic had about 5.4 million people. Of these, the rest included Rusyns, Germans, Hungarians, Romanians, Czechs, Slovaks, Romani, Armenians and others. The cities and towns of this largely rural region were mostly populated by Poles and Jews, while the Ukrainians dominated the countryside. Among the largest oil reserves in Europe were near Lviv at Drohobych and Boryslav in the upper Dniester River. Thus the stage was set for conflict between the West Ukrainian People's Republic and Poland. The West Ukrainian People's Republic was proclaimed on November 1, 1918. A few weeks later Lviv's rebellious Poles received support from Poland. On November 9 Polish forces attempted to seize the Drohobych oil fields by surprise but were driven back, outnumbered by the Ukrainians. Meanwhile, two smaller states immediately west of the West Ukrainian People's Republic, also declared independence as result of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

The Hutsul Republic was a short-lived state, formed in the aftermath of World War I. On the night of January 7–8, 1919 the local population of Rakhiv rose against the Hungarian gendarme battalion, taking into custody some 500 Hungarian policemen. General Stepan Klochurak was elected prime minister of the republic. In April 1919 most of Carpathian Ruthenia joined Czechoslovakia as an autonomous territory, while its territory was de facto a breakaway state. The state finally failed when it was occupied temporarily by Romanian troops on 11 June 1919. The territory claimed by this state became part of the First Czechoslovak Republic in September 1919. At the conclusion of World War II, the region became the Carpathian Oblast of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

It was centered on Florynka, a village in the south-east of present-day Poland. Being Russophile, its intent was unification with a democratic Russia and was opposed to a union with the West Ukrainian People's Republic. A union with Russia proved impossible, so the Republic then attempted to join Carpathian Ruthenia as an autonomous province of Czechoslovakia. This, however, was opposed by the then governor of Carpathian Ruthenia, Gregory Zatkovich. The Republic was headed by Jaroslav Kacmarcyk as President of the Central National Council. It was ended by the Polish government in March 1920. This state should not be confused with the Komancza Republic of eastern Lemkivshchyna, another short-lived republic. This was a smaller state that existed between November 23 January 1919. Lemkos History of the Lemko-Rusyn Republic Paul R.

Also involved were the Allied forces of Romania and France. The struggle resulted in the division of Ukraine between the Bolshevik Ukrainian SSR, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia. By the start of 1917 -- after the Brusilov Offensive -- the Imperial Russian Army held a front line which partially reclaimed eastern Galicia. The February Revolution of 1917 encouraged ethnic groups in the Russian Empire to demand greater autonomy and various degrees of self-determination. This Offensive was a complete disaster for the Imperial Russian Army. All this led in Petrograd, which quickly spread all over the empire. The Kiev Uprising in November 1917 led in the capital. Hostilities against the Central Rada government in Kiev began immediately. Under these circumstances, the Rada broke ties with Russia. The Rada was hard-pressed by the Kharkov government which received men and resources from the Russian SFSR. As a result, the Bolsheviks quickly overran Poltava, Aleksandrovsk, Yekaterinoslav by January 1918. Aided by the earlier Kiev Arsenal Uprising, the Red Guards entered the capital on February 1918. This forced the Central Rada to evacuate to Zhytomyr. In the meantime, the Romanians took over Bessarabia. Most Russian Army units either allied with the Bolsheviks or joined the Ukrainian People's Army.

Most populous city is Minsk. Over 40% of its 207,600 square kilometres is forested. Its strongest economic sectors are manufacturing. Belarus lost almost half of its territory after the Polish -- Soviet War of 1919 -- 1921. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost more than half of its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 Belarus became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Ukrainian SSR. Alexander Lukashenko has served since 1994. Lukashenko continued a number such as state ownership of large sections of the economy. In 2000 Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, with some hints of forming a Union State. Over 70 % of Belarus's population of million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic Belarusian, with sizable minorities of Russians, Poles and Ukrainians. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: Belarusian and Russian. The Constitution of Belarus does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Belarus is the only country in Europe to retain punishment in law and practice.

The BNR existed for ten months in 1918. The diplomatic mission was formed by its founders in Berlin. The BNR was replaced by a Communist government on January 5, 1919. It became known also as the &quot;Democratic Republic&quot;. The Byelorussian SSR was founded in Minsk. Two years later, the founders of the BNR formed a government in exile abroad. As of 2016, the Rada of the Belarusian People's Republic is the oldest still existing government-in-exile. After the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, active discussions started about either gaining autonomy within the new democratic Russia or declaring independence. The Council started working on establishing governmental institutions. The Bolsheviks and Germans refused to recognize it and interfered in its activity. However, the Germans saw an independent Belarus within Mitteleuropa. In its First Constituent Charter, passed on February 1918, the Belarusian Council declared itself the only legitimate power in the territory of Belarus. The Belarusian Council was renamed the Council of the Belarusian People's Republic. On March 1918, the Council issued a third charter declaring the independence of Belarus. Following that, local meetings were held within Belarusian cities, sued resolutions supporting the creation of an independent republic.

To the west it bordered Poland. Within the Soviet Union, it bordered Lithuania and Latvian to the north, the Russian SFSR to the east and Ukraine to the south. Byelorussia was one of several Soviet republics occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. This non-sovereign country of several million was a UN-founding-member. Towards the final years of the Soviet Republic's existence, the Supreme Soviet of Byelorussian SSR adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty on 27 July 1990. On 15 August 1991, Stanislau Shushkevich was elected as the country's first president. Ten days later on 25 August 1991, Byelorussian SSR declared its independence and renamed to the Republic of Belarus. The Soviet Union was disbanded four months later on December 26, 1991. After independence, the new Belarusian constitution was adopted on 15 March 1994, thus ending the 74-year existence of the Belarusian state. The Supreme Soviet government was replaced by the National Assembly of Belarus in 28 November 1996. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term Byelorussia was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, Byelorussia became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period. Upon the establishment of the Byelorussian Socialist Soviet Republic in 1920, the term Byelorussia was only used officially. In 1936, with the proclamation of the 1936 Soviet Constitution, the republic was renamed to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic transposing the second and third words. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus.

Russia then annexed Crimea to incorporate the federal city of Sevastopol as federal subjects of Russia. On May 1992 the same parliament inserted a new sentence into this constitution that declared that Crimea was part of Ukraine. However, political turmoil continued. After an interim constitution, the current constitution was put into effect, changing the territory's name to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Following the ratification of the May 1997 Treaty on friendship and division of the Black Sea Fleet, international tensions slowly eased. However, in 2006, anti-NATO protests broke out on the peninsula. On 24 anti-Ukrainian demonstrations were held in Crimea by ethnic Russian residents. Sergei Tsekov said then that he hoped that Russia would treat the Crimea the same way as it had treated South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Along with Verkhovna Rada, the treaty was ratified by the Russian State Duma well. On 26 thousands of pro-Russian and pro-Ukraine protesters clashed in front of the parliament building in Simferopol. Russian forces occupied airports and other strategic locations in Crimea which the interim Government of Ukraine described as an invasion and occupation. Either armed militants or Russian special forces, occupied the Crimean parliament. Under armed guard and with the doors locked, members of parliament reportedly elected Sergey Aksyonov as the new Crimean Prime Minister. The Ukrainian government did not recognize the Aksyonov administration and considers it illegal. Ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich sent a letter to Putin asking him to use military force in Ukraine to restore order.

The Crimean People's Republic existed from December 1917 to January 1918 in the Crimean Peninsula, a territory currently disputed between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Being at the time a Muslim-majority region, the Crimean People's Republic was the first attempt in the Muslim world to establish a state, secular. However the Crimean Tatars were for a while the dominant political and cultural force on the peninsula. Noman Çelebicihan was the first President of the nascent Republic. The Qurultay consisted of 76 delegates, four of whom were females. The delegates were chosen from five counties: Yalta, Akmescit, Kefe, Kezlev, Orkapy. The Qurultay elected as chairman the Crimean writer Asan Sabri Aivazov. The Board of Directors and the Central Council of Ukraine both mutually recognized each other. This attempt to build a new nation was quickly defeated by the Bolshevik- and anarchist-dominated Black Sea Fleet. Already on December 1917, the Bolsheviks captured Sevastopol where the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet was dissolved the local council of deputies. The power in the city was transferred to the local revkom. The Bolsheviks were supported by some ships of the Black Sea Fleet. Several armed incidents took place during January 1918. He was interned until February 1918, when he was shot without trial. The body of Çelebicihan was thrown into the sea.

Russia, also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a federal state in Eurasia. The western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the East, about 77 % of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. Extending across much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait. The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. It is governed as a semi-presidential republic. The Russian economy ranks by purchasing power parity in 2015. The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Russia has been characterised as a potential superpower. The name Russia is derived from a medieval state populated mostly by the East Slavs. In order to distinguish this state from other states derived from it, it is denoted by modern historiography. The name Rus itself comes from a group of Varangians who founded the state of Rus.

&quot;Crimean Regional Government&quot; refers to two successive short-lived regimes in the Crimean Peninsula during 1918 and 1919. Following Russia's 1917 October Revolution, an ethnic Tatar government proclaimed the Crimean People's Republic. The first Crimean Regional Government was established on 25 June 1918. It was formed with Lipka Tatar General Maciej Sulkiewicz as prime minister, minister of interior and military affairs. This anti-Bolshevik regime included fellow former Kadet member Maxim Vinaver as foreign minister and Vladimir D. Nabokov as minister of justice. They withdrew by early 1919. The withdrawal of the Allies had made the Crimea again fully dependent on Russia. On 2 the Soviet Red Army occupied Simferopol and the second Crimean Regional Government was dissolved. The Crimean Socialist Soviet Republic was then established only to be retaken in June 1919. The Whites under later Pyotr Wrangel held Crimea until November 1920.

The Sfatul Țării was its legislative body, while the &quot;Council of Directors General&quot;, renamed the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot; after the Declaration of Independence, was its government. The Peasants' Congress, which took place in October 1917, voted Ion Inculeț in as the new Commissar. This move was planned by Alexander Kerenski, who sent an associate professor at the University of Petrograd, to Bessarabia to take hold of the situation. Soon as the Peasants' Congress, which had no legal power, voted, Kerenski formally replaced Mimi with Inculeț. When the republic was proclaimed, Criste passed his legal powers to Inculeț. The Sfatul Țării of Bessarabia started to work in December 1917. It proclaimed the Moldavian Democratic Republic as a federal subject of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic. In the context of the October Revolution, the Russian Army on the Romanian Front disintegrated. The large number of retreating soldiers increased the level of anarchy in Bessarabia, leaving the National Council with only minimal authority over the territory. Furthermore, most of the corps nominally subjected to the National Council came under Bolshevik influence. Discouraged by the fact that the Romanian troops were already present in Chișinău, many minority deputies abstained from voting. The union was confirmed in the Treaty of Paris. Council was put in place after the country was declared independence by Daniil Ciugureanu, as President of the Council of Ministers. The Sfatul Țării was initially composed of 120 elected members, although member numbers were later increased to then 150. On 9 April, there were 138 legislators, of which 125 took part in the vote, 13 were absent.

Estonia, officially the Republic of Estonia, is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe. Across the Baltic Sea lies Finland in the north. In 1988, independence was restored on 20. August 1991. Modern Estonia is a parliamentary republic divided into fifteen counties; its capital and largest city is Tallinn. With a population of million, it is one of the least-populous member states of the European Union, Eurozone, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, OECD and Schengen Area. Estonia is a developed country with an high-income economy, among the fastest growing in the EU. It performs favourably in measurements of economic freedom, civil liberties and press freedom. The 2015 test places the Estonian high school students 3rd in the world, behind Singapore and Japan. Citizens of Estonia are provided with universal health care, the longest paid maternity leave in the OECD. Since independence the country has rapidly developed its IT sector, becoming one of the world's most digitally advanced societies. In 2005 Estonia became the first nation to in 2014 the first nation to provide E-residency. In the Estonian language, the oldest known endonym of the Estonians was maarahvas, meaning &quot;country people&quot; or &quot;people of the land&quot;. One hypothesis regarding the modern name of Estonia is that it originated from the Aesti, a people described in his Germania. However, the historic Aesti appear to have been a Baltic people, whereas the modern Estonians have Finno-Ugric origins.

Estonian War of Independence
</a>
–
It was fought in connection during 1918 -- 1920. The campaign was the struggle of Estonia for its sovereignty in the aftermath of World War I. It was concluded in the Treaty of Tartu. Thereafter, the Bolsheviks dissolved the Estonian Provincial Assembly and temporarily forced the pro-independence Estonians underground in the capital Tallinn. This first period of independence was extremely short-lived, as the German troops entered Tallinn on the following day. In late November 1918, Soviet forces moved against Estonia. On 28 the 6th Red Rifle Division struck the border town of Narva, which marked the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence. The town was defended by men of the Estonian Defence League and Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 405 of the German Army. The Reds captured Narva on 29 November, the Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 405 withdrew westwards. Military forces at the time consisted of 2,000 men with light weapons and about 14,500 poorly armed men in the Estonian Defence League. The end of November 1918 saw the formation of the Baltic Battalion, primarily a machine-gun company plus infantry. This contrasts with the Baltische Landeswehr in Latvia. The 49th Red Latvian Rifle Regiment took the Valga railway junction on Christmas Eve. Also on Christmas Eve, the 6th Red Rifle Division captured the Tapa junction, advancing to within 34 kilometers of the nation's capital Tallinn. Estonian Bolsheviks declared the Estonian Workers' Commune in Narva.

As a consequence of the Soviet occupation, both countries are home to a large number of ethnic Russians, some of whom are non-citizens. Until World War II, Latvia also had significant minorities of Jews. Latvia is predominantly Protestant Lutheran, except for the Latgale region in the southeast, which has historically been predominantly Roman Catholic. The Russian population has also brought a significant portion of Eastern Orthodox Christians.

The war involved Latvia against the Russian SFSR and the Bolsheviks' short-lived Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic. Eventually tensions flared up after a German coup against the Latvian government, leading to open war. Following a cease-fire, the Germans developed a ploy, nominally dissolving into the West Russian Volunteer Army led by Gen. Pavel Bermont-Avalov. Certain episodes of the Latvian War were also part of the Polish-Soviet War, particularly the Battle of Daugavpils. The British Empire recognizes facto independence of Latvia. 17 November: The first legislative institution of Latvia, the provisional government are established. Jānis Čakste becomes the chairman of the People’s Council, while Kārlis Ulmanis becomes prime minister. 18 November: Republic of Latvia is proclaimed in Riga. 28 November: The Regency Council of the United Baltic Duchy dissolved. 1 December: The Red Army invades Latvia. December: The government of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic, headed by Pēteris Stučka, is formed in Russia. January: The first armed unit of Latvia -- the 1st Latvian Independent Battalion, under command of Oskars Kalpaks -- is formed. The provisional government retreats to Liepāja. 31 January: Most of Latvia is under the control of the Red Army; the Latvian government and German forces control the neighborhood of Liepāja. 18 February: Agreement is signed between Estonia and Latvia, starting formation of North Latvian Brigade led by Jorģis Zemitāns on Estonian territory.

Lithuania, officially the Republic of Lithuania, is a country in Northern Europe. One of the three Baltic states, it is situated to the east of Sweden and Denmark. It is bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Kaliningrad Oblast to the southwest. Its capital and largest city is Vilnius. Lithuanians are a Baltic people. Lithuanian, along with Latvian, is one of only two living languages in the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family. For centuries, the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by Baltic tribes. With the Lublin Union of 1569, Lithuania and Poland formed the Polish -- Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighboring countries systematically dismantled it from 1772–95, with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania's territory. As World War I neared its end, Lithuania's Act of Independence was signed on 16 February 1918, declaring the founding of the modern Republic of Lithuania. Starting in 1940, Lithuania was occupied then by Nazi Germany. As the Germans retreated, the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania. Lithuania is a member of the European Union, the Council of Europe, NATO. It is also part of Nordic-Baltic cooperation of Northern European countries. The United Nations Human Development Index lists Lithuania as a &quot;very human development&quot; country.

The wars delayed the formation of civil institutions. After the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire. The Lithuanian National Revival emerged during the movement to establish an independent nation-state intensified during the early 20th century. During World War I, Lithuanian territory was occupied by Germany from 1915 until the war ended in November 1918. On February 1918, the Council of Lithuania declared the re-establishment of independence from all previous legal bonds with other states. The declaration asserted the right to self-determination, meaning the creation of a state within ethnic Lithuanian territories. However, Germany did not allow the Council to establish a Lithuanian military force, civic institutions. On November 1918 Germany signed an armistice on the Western Front and officially lost the war and control over Lithuania. The national government, led by Augustinas Voldemaras, was formed. This view was unrealistic, since military conflicts soon erupted. The legislative act creating an army was passed on November 23, 1918. Its organization moved slowly due to lack of funding, arms, ammunition, experienced military commanders. On December 20 Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras went to request assistance. However, the departure of both leaders created a domestic situation. The Council of Lithuania released Voldemaras' cabinet; Mykolas Sleževičius formed a Cabinet on 26 December 1918.

&quot;Idel-Ural&quot; means &quot;Volga-Ural&quot; in the Tatar language. As a concrete step, it was decided to create four professorships and two researchers' posts at Kazan University. The main idea was a loose League of Small Nations where all were free to strengthen their cultural heritage. At first the Muslim Bashkirs declined to participate, but later in 1917 the Volga Germans joined the League of Idel-Ural. The republic, which in reality included only parts of Kazan, was defeated by the Red Army on 28 March 1918. Sadrí Maqsudí Arsal, escaped to Finland in 1918. The president-in-exile also met officials before continuing in 1919 to Sweden, Germany and France, in a quest for Western support. Idel-Ural was listed in the Cold War-era public law of the United States. Present-day Tatar nationalists rely on the historic precedent of an independent Idel-Ural to justify the re-establishment of a Turkic independent of the Russian Federation.

The Kuban People's Republic was an anti-Bolshevik state that comprised the territory of the Kuban in the modern-day Russian Federation during the Russian Civil War. The republic was proclaimed by the Kuban Rada on January 28, 1918 and declared its independence on February 16. During its brief period of independence, it sought union with the Ukrainian People's Republic until the latter was occupied by Soviet forces. The Kuban People's Republic would include all territory of the former Kuban Oblast of the Russian Empire. It was crushed 7 November 1919 and existed for a period of 1 year 9 months. During the Russian Empire, the region of the Kuban was a Cossack territory. Like similar provinces, its demographics constituted several differences from Russian governorates. The western regions belonged to the descendants of the Black Sea Cossack Host from Ukraine in 1792. The eastern regions were made from descendants of the Don Cossacks. In return for such loyalty, they lived free from taxes in a semi-independent way with various privileges. The question of ownership often resulted in the latter's action to ensure its ownership. After the February Revolution in Petrograd, the inefficient Russian Provisional Government decided to prolong its involvement in the increasingly unpopular First World War. As a result, the Russian Army began to collapse. The Kuban Cossack units deserted the front lines and returned home to protect their homelands from a threatened Turkish invasion from the South. During the Russian Empire, the Kuban was directly administered by an appointed Ataman directly usually a non-Cossack general.

After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government installed the Special Transcaucasian Committee to govern the area. In November 1917, following the October Revolution, the first government of an independent Transcaucasia was created in Tbilisi. A Transcaucasian Committee and a Transcaucasian Commissariat existed for a couple of months. On December 5, 1917, the Committee endorsed the Armistice of Erzincan signed by the Ottoman command of the Third Army. On March 3, 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk marked the end of Russia's involvement in World War I. The Ottoman Empire regained Batum, Kars and Ardahan. Starting on March 14, the Trabzon conference was held from the Sejm. The mood in Tbilisi, however, was very different. Instead of being bound by the terms of Brest-Litovsk, the Sejm gathered and made the decision to establish independence. On 22 April 1918, it proclaimed the establishment of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. A state of war between the Republic and the Ottoman Empire was confirmed and, shortly afterwards, the Ottoman Third Army took Erzerum and Kars. A new conference was convened on May 11. No agreement was reached and, on May 21, the Ottoman forces resumed their advance. The battles of Bash Abarn, Sardarapat and Kara Killisse followed. On May 1918, the Democratic Republic of Georgia declared independence, followed two days later by the Democratic Republic of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence in 1918. The country was incorporated as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991, prior to the official dissolution of the USSR in December 1991. In September 1991, the Armenian majority of the Nagorno-Karabakh region seceded to form the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Seven adjacent districts outside it became de facto independent with the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994. These regions are internationally recognized pending a solution to the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh, found through negotiations facilitated by the OSCE. Azerbaijan is a semi-presidential republic. The country is a member state for Peace program. It is one of six independent Turkic states, the TÜRKSOY community. Azerbaijan holds membership in 38 international organizations. It is one of the founding members of GUAM, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Its term of office began on 19 June 2006.

The ADR was founded by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis on 28 May 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire. It had a population of million. Ganja was the temporary capital of the Republic as Baku was under Bolshevik control. Fatali Khan Khoyski became its prime minister. Besides the Musavat majority, Ahrar, Ittihad, Muslim Social Democrats well as representatives of Armenian, Russian, Polish, Jewish and German minorities gained seats in the parliament. Some members supported Pan-Turkist ideas. Another important accomplishment of the ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, the modern-type university founded in Azerbaijan. It was a multinational region of the Russian Empire, where 3 independent states were born later: Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. The members of Ozakom were representatives of the Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijan political elite. Ozakom announced that in the following months the most important issues, i.e. national, religious, social, were to be solved by the Transcaucasian Constituent Assembly. In the course of April and May 1917 Muslim Assemblies took place. Like ethnic minorities of Transcaucasia, Azeris aimed at secession from Russia after the February Revolution. Two general opinions were expressed by the representatives of the Muslim community: pan-Turkish, meaning joining with Turkey, federalization. The Transcaucasian region got an opportunity to decide its destiny, taking the course of federalization. After the October revolution of 1917 the Transcaucaisan government had to change its policy as Russia was now involved in the Civil War.

In December 1922, the Transcaucasian SFSR became part of the newly established Soviet Union. The Constitution of Azerbaijan SSR was approved by the 9th Extraordinary All-Azerbaijani Congress of Soviets on 14 March 1937. On 19 November 1990, Azerbaijan SSR was renamed the Republic of Azerbaijan, remaining in the USSR for another year before its independence in 1991. The Constitution of the Azerbaijan SSR ceased to exist in 1995, upon the adoption of the new Constitution of Azerbaijan. Despite this difference, the present name was chosen by the Musavat to replace the Russian names Transcaucasia and Baku in 1918. &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; derives from Persian Āzarbāydjān, from earlier Ādharbāyagān and Ādharbādhagān, from Middle Persian Āturpātākān, from Old Persian Atropatkan. From its founding it was officially known as the Azerbaijan Socialist Soviet Republic. Upon independence, it was renamed to the Republic of Azerbaijan in 1991. The current official name was retained after the new Constitution of Azerbaijan was adopted in 1995. On 13 October 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the Treaty of Kars. The previously independent Naxicivan SSR would also become an autonomous ASSR within Azerbaijan by the Treaty of Kars. Borders of Azerbaijan and Armenia, like elsewhere in the USSR, were redrawn several times, yet neither side was completely satisfied with the results. On 12 the leaders of Georgian Soviet Socialist Republics established a union known as the Transcaucasian SFSR. This was the first attempt at a union of Soviet republics, preceding the USSR. The Union Council of TSFSR consisted of the representatives of the three republics – Nariman Narimanov, Polikarp Mdivani, Aleksandr Fyodorovich Miasnikyan.

Most of the conflicts did not have a principal pattern with a armed structure. The conflicts involved civilians in the disputed districts of Kazakh-Shamshadin, Zanghezur, Nakhchivan and Karabakh. The reasons behind the conflict are still far from being resolved after nearly a century. The story of this campaign has very different perceptions from Azerbaijani viewpoints. The first clashes between the Armenians and Azeris took place in February 1905. Musavat and Committee of Union and Progress parties were accused by Bolsheviks and their allies. Muslim militias engaged in armed confrontations, which resulted in heavy casualties. Many Muslims went underground. This led to three days fighting,resulting in the death of up to 12,000 Azeris. At the same time the Baku Commune was involved in heavy fighting in and around Ganja. The Ottoman Empire's Enver Pasha began to move forward with the newly established Army of Islam. Major battles occurred in Yevlakh and Agdash. The capital of the Azerbaijan was finally moved to Baku. However, after the Armistice of the Ottoman Empire on October 30, Turkish troops were substituted by the Triple Entente. Headed by British Gen. W. Thomson, who had declared the military governor of Baku, 1,000 Commonwealth soldiers arrived in Baku on November 17, 1918.

The invasion coincided with the anti-government insurrection staged in the capital Baku. By early 1920, Soviet Russia desperately needed oil supplies from Baku. On March 1920, Vladimir Lenin sent the following telegraph to the Revolutionary Military Council on the Caucasus Front: We absolutely must take Baku. Same applies to Georgia, although in this case I advise you to be even more careful. According to our intelligence, only Azerbaijani force is defending the station of Yalama -- Baku. In accordance with received directives, I order: 1. For the commander of 11th Army to cross the border Azerbaijan on April 27 and, in a quick offensive, to take control of the Baku province. Yalama—Baku operation to be concluded within 5 days. The cavalry units must be sent to take control of the Transcaucasian railroad around Kurdamir. 2. By the time, when 11th Army approaches the Absheron Peninsula, commander of the flotilla, Raskolnikov, to ensure landing of a small unit around the Alat station. This unit shall take orders from the commander of 11th Army. This scheme was used decades later during the Soviet invasions in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. On 28 the Baku Revolutionary Committee filed a formal request for help with the Soviet Russian Government. But the 11th Red Army, including the 26th, 28th and 32nd rifle divisions and 2nd mounted corps, already invaded the territory of Azerbaijan.

The republic was established in the Armenian-populated territories of the disintegrated Russian Empire, known as Russian Armenia. The leaders of the government came mostly from the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. It had a total area of roughly 107,600 km ², a population of 2.5 million. The Armenian National Council declared the independence of Armenia on 28 May 1918. From the very onset, Armenia was plagued with a variety of foreign problems. A humanitarian crisis emerged from the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide from the Ottoman Empire settled there. The republic lasted over two years, during which time it was involved in several armed conflicts caused by territorial disputes. By late 1920, the nation was conquered by the Soviet Red Army. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the republic regained its independence in 1991. The Russians continued to make considerable advances even after the toppling of Tsar Nicholas II in February 1917. In March 1917, the spontaneous revolution that toppled the Romanov dynasty established a caretaker administration, known as the Provisional Government. Shortly after, the Provisional Government replaced Grand Duke Nicholas' administration in the Caucasus with the Special Transcaucasian Committee, known by the acronym Ozakom. The Ozakom was set to heal wounds inflicted by the old regime. In doing so, Western Armenia was to have a general commissar and was to be subdivided into the districts of Trebizond, Erzerum, Bitlis, Van. The decree was a major concession to the Armenians: Western Armenia was placed under immediate Armenian jurisdiction.

It was established in December 1920, when the Soviets took over control of the short-lived First Republic of Armenia and lasted until 1991. It is sometimes called the Second Republic of Armenia, following the First Republic of Armenia's demise. Its independence was recognised on 26 December 1991 when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the state of the post-Union Republic of Armenia existed until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995. The modern Armenian Hayastan derives from earlier Armenian Hayk’ and Persian -stān. Hayk’ derives from Old Armenian Haykʿ, traditionally derived from a legendary patriarch named Hayk. Aram above was considered to be one of his descendants. Officially, the name of the republic was the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic as defined by the 1937 and 1978 constitutions. After the October Revolution, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin's government announced that minorities in the empire could pursue a course of self-determination. A number of Armenians joined the advancing 11th Soviet Red Army. The medieval Armenian capital of Ani, as well as the cultural icon of the Armenian people Mount Ararat, were located in the ceded area. Additionally, Joseph Stalin, then acting Commissar for Nationalities, granted the areas of Nakhchivan and Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan. The republic began under the name the Socialist Soviet Republic of Armenia in 1920. From March 1922 to December 1936, Armenia was a part of the Transcaucasian SFSR together with the Azerbaijan SSR. Devoid of revolutionary planning, executed with needless brutality, these confiscations were unorganized and promiscuous.

It was established by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation forces under command of Garegin Nzhdeh, following the suppression of the February Uprising in April 1921. It existed until mid-July, the same year. But the Allies were more concerned with concluding the other European members of the Central Powers. While there were the United States was reluctant to accept a mandate over Armenia. Meanwhile, the recently formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and Turkish National Movement had both set their sights on taking over the Caucasus, including Armenia. The Bolsheviks sympathized with the Turkish Movement due to their mutual opposition to the western powers, or &quot;Western Imperialism,&quot; as the Bolsheviks referred to it. The Soviet government started sending them gold and weapons. Eventually Western Armenia fell to the invading forces. Armenia gave way in late 1920. The Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started on the 29th of November 1920. Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviet Government proposed the annexation of Armenia to Soviet Azerbaijan. This step was strongly rejected by Garegin Nzhdeh, who declared Syunik on December 25, 1920. Njdeh again proved himself as a long-sighted politician, he continued his struggle against the Red Army and Soviet Azerbaijan. On 18 the ARF led an anti-Soviet rebellion in Yerevan and seized power.

Turkish-Armenian War
</a>
–
The Turkish army under Kâzım Karabekir defeated Armenia, capturing territory which the Ottoman Empire had lost to the Russian Empire in 1855 and 1878. The military victory was followed by Soviet Russia's occupation and sovietization of Armenia. Armenia's most problem was its dispute with its neighbor to the west, the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans had killed as many as million Armenians during the Armenian Genocide. But the Allies were more concerned with concluding the other European members of the Central Powers. The Turkish Nationalists considered any partition of formerly Ottoman lands to be unacceptable. Their avowed goal was to &quot;guarantee the unity of the country.&quot; The Bolsheviks sympathized to &quot;Western Imperialism,&quot; as the Bolsheviks referred to it. Despite the concessions made by the Turks, the military supplies were slow in coming. Only after the decisive Battle of Sakarya, the aid started to flow in faster. After much delays, the Armenians received from the Allies in July 1920 with a great amount of ammunition. It was not until August 1920 that the Allies drafted the settlement of the Near East, in the form of the Treaty of Sèvres. The US allotted four of the six eastern provinces including an outlet to the Black Sea. The Treaty of Sèvres served to confirm Kemal's suspicions about Allied plans to partition the empire. According to Soviet sources, Turkish plans to take back formerly Ottoman-controlled lands in the east were already in place as early as June 1920.

Democratic Republic of Georgia
</a>
–
The Democratic Republic of Georgia existed from May 1918 to February 1921 and was the first modern establishment of a Republic of Georgia. The DRG was created after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917. It had a total area of a population of 2.5 million. Its state language was Georgian. Proclaimed on May 1918, on the break-up of the Transcaucasian Federation, it was led by the Georgian Social Democratic Party. The Bolshevist October Revolution changed the situation drastically. The Caucasian soviets refused to recognize Vladimir Lenin's regime. Many Georgians, influenced from the late 19th century, insisted on national independence. A national awakening was further strengthened by the restoration of the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church and establishment of a national university in Tbilisi. In contrast, the Georgian Mensheviks considered calls for Georgia's independence chauvinistic and separatist. The union of Transcaucasus was short-lived though. Noe Ramishvili formed the first government of Democratic Republic of Georgia. Georgia was immediately recognized by the Ottoman Empire. The young state had to cede its largely Muslim-inhabited regions to the Ottoman government. However, German support enabled the Georgians to repel the Bolshevik threat from Abkhazia.

Georgian SSR
</a>

From November 18, 1989, the Georgian SSR declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws. The Georgian state officially ended on August 1995 when the new official constitution of Georgia was ratified. Geographically the Georgian SSR was bordered to the west. Within the Soviet Union it bordered the Russian SFSR to the south-east. On November 28, 1917, after the October Revolution in Russia, there was a Transcaucasian Commissariat headed by Mensheviks established in Tiflis. The Socialist Soviet Republic of Georgia was established on February 25, 1921. On March 2 of the following year the first constitution of Soviet Georgia was accepted. From March 1922 to December 1936 it was part of the Transcaucasian SFSR together with the Armenian SSR and the Azerbaijan SSR. In 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved. In 1936, Georgia became the Soviet Socialist Republic. Lavrentiy Beria became head of purged Georgia until he was transferred in 1938. The country was a vital source of munitions. He abolished their respective autonomous republics. The Georgian SSR was briefly granted some of their territory until 1957. The program introduced in the mid-1950s was soon exploited by Georgian Communist Party officials to build their own regional power base.

Sochi conflict
</a>
–
In 19th century, before the Caucasian War, the disputed area was inhabited by Ubykhs and other Adyghe people. The Black Sea district was only thinly inhabited since the Russian Empire took control of the area forcing thousands of locals to become Muhajirs. The region was also inhabited by a significant number of Armenians and Georgians. A Georgian force under Major General Giorgi Mazniashvili was joined by an Abkhaz cavalry provided by local nobility. The military operation, encouraged also by a German military mission, resulted in the occupation of Adler, Sochi, Tuapse along the Black Sea coastline. Initially, Georgia regarded the White forces from the Bolshevist Moscow. This cooperation was, however, soon clouded by Denikin's calls for the reunited &quot;Great Russia&quot; as its integral part. Early in September, the Georgians were forced out by the retreating Taman Red Army pursued by Denikin's forces. Soon the White units took control of the town on September 8 forcing the Bolsheviks to retreat further toward Armavir. The annexation by Georgia caused an acute protest from the leaders of the White forces. On September 1918, the White leaders and representatives of the DRG met in Ekaterinodar to find a peaceful solution to the dispute. Denikin demanded that the Georgians withdraw back to the Bzyb river. The Whites halted the negotiations next day. The British representatives intervened establishing a demarcation line along the Bzyb. The Georgian officers were released.

</a>

Soviet forces declared the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic on 25 February 1921. It was not until September 1924 that Soviet rule was firmly established. Georgia effectively escaped Russian control in Russia in 1917. The operational centre of the military-political forces in the Caucasus was the Kavburo attached to the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party. Set up in February 1920, this body was chaired with Sergey Kirov as his vice-chairman. The Soviet leadership successfully sent in its army to occupy Baku, the capital of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. When the coup failed, the Georgian government was able to concentrate all its forces on successfully blocking the Soviet advance over the Georgian-Azerbaijani border. Facing a difficult war with Poland, Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin ordered a start with Georgia. In the Treaty of Moscow signed on 7 May 1920, Soviet Russia concluded a non-aggression pact. The treaty established the existing borders between the two nations de jure and also obliged Georgia to surrender all third-party elements considered hostile by Moscow. In a secret supplement, Georgia promised to legalize the local Bolshevik party. Despite the treaty, an eventual overthrow of the Menshevik-dominated government of Georgia was both intended and planned. Stalin called his homeland &quot;the kept woman of the Western Powers&quot;. By that time, the West was reluctant to intervene in support of Georgia. He strongly continuously urged Lenin to give his consent for an advance into Georgia.

Ties were established with Georgia, which recognized the emirate's authorities. However, they became dependent on Bolshevik aid until its suspension.

The Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus was a short-lived state situated in the Northern Caucasus. It broke away from the Russian Empire during the February Revolution, shortly before the start of the Russian Civil War. The total area was about 70,000 square kilometers, with a population of about 1 million. Its capital was initially at Vladikavkaz, then Nazran, finally Temir-Khan-Shura. The state was captured by Russian forces in 1920, who transformed it into the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. An Executive Committee of the Union was elected. The Chairman of the Executive Committee was one of the leaders of the National‐Liberation movement of the Peoples of Tapa Tchermoeff. The &quot;Nizam&quot; of Imam Shamil was adopted on 5 August 1917 by the &quot;Central Committee of the Northern Caucasus&quot;. The main founders of the MRNC included Said Shamil, Prime Minister Tapa Tchermoeff, Haidar Bamat. The Republic's capital was Temir-Khan-Shura. The Mountainous Republic was de jure recognized by Germany, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the Democratic Republic of Georgia and the Kuban People's Republic. During the Russian Civil War, the Mountaineers were engaged in fierce clashes against the invading White troops of General Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army. The fighting ended in January 1920, when Denikin's army was completely defeated by the XI Red Army. In June 1920, the Government of the republic was forced to leave the Caucasus. In January 1921, the Soviet Mountain Republic of the Russian SFSR was established.

The Basmachi movement or Basmachi Revolt was an uprising against Russian Imperial and Soviet rule by the Muslim peoples of Central Asia. In the months following the October 1917 Revolution the Bolsheviks seized power in many parts of the Russian Empire and the Russian Civil War began. Political movements attempted to form an autonomous government in the Ferghana Valley. The Bolsheviks launched an assault on Kokand in February 1918 and carried out a general massacre of up to 25,000 people. The fortunes of the decentralized movement fluctuated throughout the early 1920s but by 1923 the Red Army's extensive campaigns had dealt the Basmachis many defeats. After major Red Army campaigns and concessions regarding economic and Islamic practices in the mid-1920s, the military fortunes and popular support of the Basmachi declined. Resistance to Russian Soviet leadership did flare again, in response to collectivization campaigns in the pre-Second World War era. Prior to World War I, Russian Turkestan was ruled from Tashkent as a Krai or Governor-Generalship. To the east of Tashkent, the Ferghana Valley was an ethnically diverse, densely populated region, divided between settled farmers and nomads. Under Russian rule, it was converted into a major cotton-growing region. On the whole, living standards did not improve, many farmers became indebted. Many criminals organized into bands, forming the basis for the early Basmachi movement when it began in the Ferghana Valley. A rural proletariat soon developed. Muslim clergy decried the gambling and alcoholism that became commonplace, crime rose considerably. Major violence in Russian Turkestan broke out in 1916, when the Tsarist government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.
