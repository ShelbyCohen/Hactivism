            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally,
            after years of disintegration and defeat on the Left,
            a new movement has erupted upon the political
            landscape. It is not organized around a single issue,
            identity based, or somehow &ldquo;implicitly&rdquo;
            radical. On the contrary, this movement directly
            attacks global capital&rsquo;s economic and political
            infrastructure with a radically democratic politics
            and a strategy of confrontation. It is bold,
            anti-authoritarian, and truly global.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">And also quite
            effective. This movement has already introduced a
            radical critique into the debate on the global
            economy and demonstrated the capacity to physically
            shut down meetings of trade ministers. It seems
            possible that this movement will continue to grow,
            deepen its radicalism, and revolutionize the world
            according to the radically democratic principles it
            embraces.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The emergence of the
            anti-globalization movement has produced a feeling of
            near euphoria among anarchists. Not only are our
            commitments to direct action and decentralization
            shared broadly in the movement as a whole, but we are
            also enjoying a political legitimacy that has eluded
            us for decades. We can now articulate our
            anti-statist, utopian message to activists around the
            world and we are no longer dismissed as terrorists or
            cranks. In many respects it seems like we should just
            mobilize, mobilize, and mobilize.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately this
            would be a grave mistake. The movement&rsquo;s
            anti-authoritarian, revolutionary character is
            currently under attack by a informal network of
            reformists, who want nothing more than to see this
            movement accommodate itself to the basic structures
            of the present world. They are not waging a direct
            assault upon revolutionaries in the movement: they
            recognize that this would alienate them from the
            movement&rsquo;s base. Instead, they are fighting us
            indirectly, in the realm of ideas. In particular,
            they hope to define the movement in a way that
            renders its most expansive, utopian potentials
            literally unthinkable.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As important as it is
            to mobilize, anarchists will have to respond to this
            challenge on the theoretical terrain: we cannot
            afford to lose the battle of ideas. Above all, we
            must link the anti-globalization movement to a
            broader revolutionary project in a way that is
            coherent, concrete, and irrefutable. However, as a
            defensive measure, we should expose the
            reformist&rsquo;s attempt to sever this link and
            reveal their designs to the movement as a whole. The
            reformers will respond by declaring their good faith
            or complaining about our divisiveness, but we should
            not be swayed by such pre-political subterfuge: on
            the contrary, we should be merciless with those who
            would hinder the realization of the
            anti-globalization movement&rsquo;s most radical
            possibilities. Popular revolutionary movements have
            been betrayed countless times before: we should not
            let this happen again.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><em>Naming the
            Enemy</em> and <em>Globalization from Below</em> are
            exemplary documents of the reformist wing of the
            anti-globalization movement. They are more reflective
            and sophisticated than the majority of books on the
            movement and focus on the deeper questions upon which
            its identity hangs. These two works celebrate the
            movement&rsquo;s radicalism emphatically, but in
            terms that make the revolutionary transformation of
            the social order inconceivable.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In <em>Globalization from Below</em>, Jeremy 
          Brecher, Tim Costello, and Brendan Smith (BCS) argue that the economic, 
          political, and cultural interconnectedness signified by globalization 
          is irreversible and possibly a good thing: this interconnection, they 
          assert, could potentially serve the interests of people and the earth, 
          not just the elites. Although the rich and powerful have shaped globalization 
          in their interest thus far (BCS call this &ldquo;globalization from 
          above&rdquo;), there is a counter-movement that seeks to reshape our 
          interconnected world in the interests of people and the planet (which 
          BCS call &ldquo;globalization from below&rdquo;). They believe that 
          the movement for &ldquo;globalization from below&rdquo; is disparate 
          but growing, and their book is meant to provide a framework for uniting 
          it into a common, grassroots struggle. They want to build a world structured 
          by &ldquo;human values other than greed and domination,&rdquo; one &ldquo;less 
          dominated by the culture and values of global capital, even if it is 
          still constrained by them,&rdquo; and believe their book provides a 
          realistic strategy for doing so.(<a href="#1" title=
            "1"><u>1</u></a>) They believe that the movement for &ldquo;globalization 
          from below&rdquo; can transform the world by leading people to withdraw 
          their consent from dominant social relationships, which will prevent 
          the reproduction of the social order, and thus create a situation in 
          which the movement can impose different, more just norms upon society 
          as a whole. BCS try to concretize these norms with a detailed program 
          for reducing poverty, limiting environmental destruction, and enhancing 
          democratic control over the economy. They believe their program embodies 
          values &ldquo;already shared by many in this movement and that [it] 
          is implicit in much of what the movement actually does.&rdquo;(<a href="#2"
            title="2"><u>2</u></a>) Their attractive and short book (122 pages) 
          is clearly conceived, written without jargon, and can be read for its 
          programmatic suggestions as well as deeper speculations into the nature 
          of social movements.</font></p> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Amory Starr's <em>Naming the Enemy</em> 
          is a comparative analysis of the ways activists in the anti-globalization 
          movement criticize global capital and the types of alternatives they 
          envision. She offers a panoramic view of the movement structured around 
          three responses to global capital: restraining it, democratizing it, 
          or building local alternatives to it. In her first category, which she 
          calls &ldquo;contestation and reform,&rdquo; she examines movements 
          that want to restrain global capital through state regulation. Here 
          she treats movements against structural adjustment, peace and human 
          rights groups, movements for land reform, the explicitly anti-corporate 
          movement, and cyber-punk. Her second category is &ldquo;globalization 
          from below,&rdquo; or movements that want to democratize globalization 
          by making governments and corporations accountable to people instead 
          of elites. Here she looks at the environmental and labor movements, 
          socialist movements, anti-free trade movements, and the Zapatistas. 
          Her final category is &ldquo;delinking,&rdquo; in which she treats movements 
          that want to separate from global capital and build locally based alternatives 
          to it, such as the anarchist movement, movements for sustainable development, 
          the small businesses movement, sovereignty movements, and religious 
          nationalist movements. <em>Naming the Enemy</em> is international in 
          scope, although based on English language sources exclusively, and tries 
          to engage an academic and activist audience. While the book is sometimes 
          suffocated by absurdly academic jargon,(<a href="#3"
            title="3"><u>3</u></a>) she provides a sweeping, ground-level view 
          of the movement through studies of manifestos, campaigns, and virtually 
          any resource in which anti-globalization activists articulate how they 
          &ldquo;understand their enemy and envision rebuilding the world.&rdquo;(<a href="#4" title=
            "4"><u>4</u></a>)</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both BCS and Starr
            embrace the anti-globalization movement and clearly
            hope their books will contribute to its growth and
            self-understanding. BCS advance a program and
            framework for uniting the movement into a broad
            struggle against &ldquo;globalization from
            above&rdquo; whereas Starr offers a comprehensive
            analysis of the goals (and opponents) identified by
            movement activists. It is tempting to regard these
            works as statements from sympathetic participants in
            a diverse, growing movement, and I suspect that Starr
            and BCS hope we will.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face=
            "Arial"><strong>Revolution</strong><br>
             But those of us who believe that &ldquo;another
            world is possible&rdquo; need to approach these books
            with very specific concerns. We should ask: do they
            link the anti-globalization movement to a broader
            revolutionary project or do they at least provide
            insights that could help us establish such a
            link?</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Naturally the answer
            to this question depends on the meaning of the word
            &ldquo;revolution,&rdquo; which has been subject to
            considerable and ongoing debate. The Left has
            normally used the term to designate not only a
            sweeping change in political, economic, and cultural
            relationships, but also the moment when one
            historical epoch gives birth to a totally new
            landscape of historical experience through a process
            of contradiction, collapse, and renewal. It is in
            this sense that the Left has always had a utopian
            dimension.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The idea of revolution
            is barely a concern for Starr or BCS and, to the
            extent that it is, they seem to restrict it to the
            transformation of political institutions (instead of
            society as a whole). BCS mention the idea of
            revolution in passing and, even then, only to state
            that it depends on &ldquo;solving problems by means
            of state power.&rdquo;(<a href="#5" title=
            "5"><u>5</u></a>) Starr does not discuss the idea at
            all, although she suggests a theory of revolution in
            a treatment of reformist movements. For her, reform
            means &ldquo;mobilizing existing formal democratic
            channels of protest, seeking national legislation,
            mounting judicial challenges, mobilizing
            international agencies, boycotting and
            protesting.&rdquo;(<a href="#6" title=
            "6"><u>6</u></a>) Thus, presumably, revolutionary
            movements are not oriented toward the existing
            political structures but rather fight for new ones.
            This suggests that Starr, like BCS, thinks of
            revolution only in terms of the transformation of
            political institutions (and her distinction between
            movements that engage existing political institutions
            and those that fight for new ones is not substantive:
            movements are not revolutionary merely because they
            fight for something new).</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But do they provide
            insights that could help us link the
            anti-globalization movement to a larger revolutionary
            project?</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many
            anarcho-syndicalists and communists link the
            anti-globalization movement to revolution by
            affirming the analysis of capitalism advanced by late
            19th and early 20th century socialists. According to
            this view, capitalism&rsquo;s central and fatal
            contradiction is the class conflict between the
            bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Specifically,
            capitalism creates an industrial proletariat that
            must, in turn, fight for its interests as a class.
            Ultimately the proletariat becomes so numerous and
            impoverished that it will not only fight for
            immediate benefits but also against the social order
            that has produced it as a class: the class struggle
            then unfolds into revolution and capitalism as a
            whole is destroyed. Although communists and
            anarcho-syndicalists recognize that the
            anti-globalization movement is not a revolutionary
            working class movement, they believe it will become
            one when the movement grasps the real nature of
            economic inequality: in this sense the movement is a
            first, but partial step toward a broader
            revolutionary struggle. Ultimately groups that
            explicitly embraced a revolutionary socialist
            perspective, such as the Russian Bolsheviks or the
            Spanish anarchists, will have to provide the model
            for the movement as a whole. (This is why communists
            and anarcho-syndicalists are so focused on political
            lessons derived from pre-WWII events such as the
            Russian Revolution and Spanish Civil War.)</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We will not find
            support for this idea in <em>Naming the Enemy</em> or
            <em>Globalization from Below</em>. Neither believe
            that capitalism is subject to fatal contradictions
            (class, or otherwise) nor that it should be
            transcended as a social form. In fact, BCS seek not
            only to retain but also to improve the capitalist
            mode of production: for example, they argue that
            their economic program will &ldquo;expand employment
            and markets and generate a virtuous cycle of economic
            growth.&rdquo;(<a href="#7" title="7"><u>7</u></a>)
            Starr eliminates the question altogether by defining
            the anti-globalization movement as anti-corporate
            instead of anti-capitalist.(<a href="#8" title=
            "8"><u>8</u></a>) Accordingly, the category of class
            is not important for BCS or Starr&rsquo;s analysis of
            the anti-globalization movement and neither attempt
            to relate the interests of the working class to the
            fate of the movement as a whole (Starr explicitly
            argues that labor struggles based on class interest
            do not challenge the corporate form(<a href="#9"
            title="9"><u>9</u></a>)). For them,
            anarcho-syndicalists and communists are mistaken to
            draw a link between the anti-globalization movement
            and the older revolutionary socialist
            movements.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But clearly there are
            other ways to conceive of revolution than as a
            consequence of class contradictions: for example, it
            is possible to imagine revolution in a democratic
            populist sense, in which people draw upon shared
            values (as opposed to class interests) to overthrow
            elites. This vision of revolution is not premised
            upon the exacerbation of class conflict, but rather
            the emergence of a democratic sentiment that rejects
            exclusive, non-participatory social institutions. BCS
            and Starr offer some support for understanding the
            anti-globalization movement in these terms. BCS
            explicitly define the movement as a people&rsquo;s
            movement designed to &ldquo;restrain global
            capital&rdquo;(<a href="#10" title=
            "10"><u>10</u></a>) and Starr implies the same thing
            by focusing on the ideals, not class positions, of
            activists within the movement. However, Starr and BCS
            fail to articulate this democratic perspective in a
            way that could make a revolutionary transformation of
            the social order comprehensible. BCS want to place
            global capitalism under the control of democratic
            political institutions at the local, national, and
            international levels (they call this a
            &ldquo;multi-level alternative&rdquo;). However,
            their program for democratizing the economy is not
            complemented by a program for democratizing political
            power (in fact, campaign finance reform is the only
            explicitly political demand they advance). This is
            because they do not advocate (or even mention) direct
            democracy: on the contrary, they believe in
            representative democracy and are thus largely content
            with the political structures it presupposes. For
            example, they are oblivious to the inherently
            anti-democratic nature of the nation-state and
            institutions based upon it (such as the UN), not to
            mention the political apparatuses they imply, such as
            politicians, political parties, and advocacy groups.
            So, despite their democratic rhetoric and enthusiasm
            for extra-parliamentary social movements, their
            vision preserves the political structure of the world
            as it presently exists.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">BCS&rsquo;s
            theoretical premises also make it impossible to
            conceive of a significant historical leap. For BCS,
            the social order is shaped by a balance between the
            powerful and the powerless (not necessarily classes).
            They write that the power of any society &ldquo;is
            based on the active cooperation of some people and
            the consent and/or acquiescence of others. It is the
            activity of people&mdash;going to work, paying taxes,
            buying products, obeying government officials,
            staying off private property&mdash;that continually
            re-creates the power of the powerful.&rdquo;(<a href=
            "#11" title="11"><u>11</u></a>) This is why social
            movements can transform these social relationships
            when they lead people to withdraw their consent from
            the dominant arrangements: people stop acquiescing
            and thus prevent the reproduction of the social
            order, enabling the movement to impose its own norms
            on society as a whole (for example, think of the
            civil rights movement). This vision of social change
            seems laudable, given its emphasis on the power of
            the oppressed in the reproduction and transformation
            of societies, but it has two fundamental problems.
            First, BCS do not explain why a people may develop
            norms that contradict the status quo, and thus cannot
            explain why they would want to withdraw their consent
            from the prevailing social relationships in the first
            place. Second, their assertion that society is always
            defined by a truce between the powerful and the
            powerless could characterize any social formation,
            from the birth of society to the end of history, and
            thus lacks any historical content. However, if we
            wish to retain this trans-historical principle, then
            we must conclude that social movements can only
            strike a new balance of disempowerment at the very
            best. There is no transcendence, no realm of freedom,
            in this vision.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While Starr does not
            advance a democratic revolutionary perspective, her
            work is more amenable to such a stance than
            BCS&rsquo;s. She treats movements that explicitly
            assert a democratic vision against the existing power
            structure and suggests that this orientation is both
            coherent and legitimate (she tries to defend
            anarchist as well as other decentralist tendencies
            against their academic and social democratic
            critics).(12) Also, the fact that she studies how
            actors in the anti-globalization movement conceive of
            their opponents and want to rebuild the world
            suggests that Starr regards our ideals and
            commitments as the most important factors in
            political action, not the &ldquo;objective
            development of class contradictions.&rdquo; This
            value-based approach is a precept of any
            revolutionary democratic politics.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although she tries to
            support anti-statist movements that are fighting
            global capital, her efforts are theoretically and
            empirically unsound. Instead of treating these
            movements as instances of a democratic, anti-statist
            tradition she defines them merely as localist
            movements that want to &ldquo;delink&rdquo; (or
            separate) from the global economy. This makes little
            sense: there are virtually no localists in the
            anti-globalization movement, but rather decentralist
            movements that regard the community (not the state)
            as the locus of political life and want to
            reconstruct the world around a new relationship
            between communities.(<a href="#13" title=
            "13"><u>13</u></a>) These movements are not
            localist&mdash;they do not simply want to retreat
            into their own enclaves&mdash;but rather
            communitarian movements fighting for the
            decentralization of political power. But also, on a
            theoretical level, her definition severs these
            movements from a broader democratic legacy, and thus
            obscures a tradition that connects (for example)
            Zapatista municipal radicalism to Proudhon&rsquo;s
            federalism. She even mentions the Proudhonian
            federalist tradition, but fails to theorize its
            presence in these decentralist movements. Thus, her
            defense of the most radical wing in the
            anti-globalization movement presupposes a sharp
            misreading of its politics. Even worse, her
            conception of localism-as-radicalism leads her to
            defend religious nationalists and their efforts to
            impose parochial, blood-based restraints on the world
            economy: for example, she mentions radical Islamic
            nationalists and the U.S.&rsquo;s racist Christian
            Patriot movement. While these groups may share an
            emphasis on the locality with decentralist tendencies
            in the anti-globalization movement, religious
            nationalists are regressive to the extreme, whereas
            decentralists are confederal and cosmopolitan in the
            best sense of the terms. Starr&rsquo;s effort to
            soften this divide is less than
            compelling.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But even if Starr
            related her analysis to a democratic tradition, there
            is a problem in the very constitution of <em>Naming
            the Enemy</em>. She does not study movements on the
            basis of their &ldquo;size, scope, practices or
            chances for success,&rdquo;(<a href="#14" title=
            "14"><u>14</u></a>) but only on the basis of their
            ideals. This tends to broaden her picture of the
            anti-globalization movement, given that the most
            exciting developments in the movement are not always
            the largest, most influential, or most likely to
            succeed. However, some criteria must be applied to
            determine whose intentions are relevant: after all,
            countless groups declare their opposition to the
            consequences of global capitalism, from the Cuban
            Communist Party to the Catholic Church. But of course
            one cannot study a movement solely on the basis of
            its declarations any more than one can study a person
            on the basis of his or her self-description. Starr
            knows this, but refuses to spell out the criteria she
            uses to select movements for consideration. It is
            clear that she embraces some form of left-wing,
            democratic populism (&aacute; la <em>Z Magazine</em>)
            but theorizing these commitments would put her in
            opposition to the radical skepticism and liberal
            resignation prevailing in academia at the
            moment.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face=
            "Arial"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
             That Starr and BCS welcome the emergence of a
            democratic, direct action-based movement against
            global capital is an indication of the success of the
            anti-authoritarian tradition. Years ago they might
            have called for a small &ldquo;c&rdquo; communism or
            some form of Green Party-like electoralism but,
            instead, they praise this anti-authoritarian movement
            for its democratic sentiments, commitment to protest,
            and oppositional stance. They want to speak the
            language of the growing movement against global
            capitalism.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yet they would lure us
            into a trap: they are not revolutionaries, their
            books do not provide terms through which we can link
            this movement to a broader revolutionary project, and
            their basic theoretical commitments are fundamentally
            antagonist to the goal of revolutionary
            transformation. BCS&rsquo;s <em>Globalization from
            Below</em> is comprehensible because it affirms the
            basic structure of the present world&mdash;that is,
            capitalism and the nation-state&mdash;and is thus
            written with the clarity and repose of those who have
            already won. They descend into platitudes when they
            try to relate their ideas to a project of radical
            social transformation precisely because they do not
            want such a transformation. Starr becomes
            incomprehensible, dipping into jargon and an absurd
            defense of religious nationalism, because she wants
            to reject the present but is unwilling to embrace the
            terms that would make such a refusal
            coherent.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Neither BCS nor Starr
            should be regarded as deceitful or malicious and,
            besides, their motives are of little significance.
            What must be recognized is that they are on different
            sides of the debate over the anti-globalization
            movement than those of us who genuinely believe that
            a new world is possible. They celebrate the movement,
            but the terms of their analyses are hostile to its
            best, most visionary dimensions.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our capacity to push
            the anti-globalization movement from opposition to
            revolution will be destroyed if we accept the
            premises of their books, either passively or
            otherwise. Even if demonstrations and militant
            conflicts with the police were to continue, we cannot
            fight for a revolution that we cannot
            conceive.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I think anarchists
            have been correct to greet the anti-globalization
            movement with enthusiasm: I believe that
            extraordinary potentials are at hand. However, to
            realize these potentials, we must confront those who
            would erase them from the historical agenda. This
            will allow us to preserve the idea that new,
            emancipated landscapes of historical experience are
            available to us and to set about creating
            them.</font></p>
