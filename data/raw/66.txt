Perhaps you’re bringing your mother, your grandmother, your daughter, your sister? You’ll be in good company. Per the event’s Facebook page at press time, 176,000 people are planning to attend, with another 250,000 still on the fence. It seems likely, said Linda Sarsour, one of four national cochairs acting as spokeswomen for the movement, that it will be “the largest mass mobilization that any new administration has seen on its first day.”<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="ad __no-background" data-reactid="127"><div class="ad--inner" data-cns="intext_first_page_1" id="" data-reactid="128"></div></div><p data-reactid="129"><!-- react-text: 130 -->Ahead of our shoot, emails flew back and forth about just how many organizers we could expect to show for the portrait. First it was 10. Then 15. Fourteen women materialized, but several of them informed me that it might have been more like 20.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="131"><!-- react-text: 132 -->That fluidity says something about the Women’s March and how it functions; it’s an organic, grassroots effort that prides itself on being inclusive, intersectional, and nonhierarchical, on taking what Bob Bland (one of the movement’s cofounders, now serving as a national cochair) called “a horizontal approach to leadership.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="133"><!-- react-text: 134 -->It’s also an all-hands-on-deck, eleventh-hour, race-to-the-finish-line kind of endeavor, which has required all 10, or 15, or 16, or 20 of its chief orchestrators to work around the clock since the week of the election. This is the type of national effort that the group’s communications czar, Cassady Fendlay, told me could take “six months to a year to plan.” These women had just over two months to pull it off.<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="ad__in-text" data-reactid="135"><div class="ad--inner" data-reactid="136"><div class="ad--wrapper" id="in-text-ad-0_300x251_frame" data-reactid="137"></div></div></div><p data-reactid="138"><!-- react-text: 139 -->“We don’t sleep much, as you can probably tell from all our faces,” Sarsour said drily, her own face framed by a fuchsia head scarf. She’s Brooklyn born and bred (with the accent to prove it), the Muslim daughter of Palestinian immigrants, and a veteran activist who heads up the march’s fundraising efforts. She juggles that with, among other things, her job as executive director of the Arab American Association of New York.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="140"><!-- react-text: 141 -->Sarsour was sitting with me during a bit of downtime before the shoot. “Hey, sweetie; hey, sweetie,” she greeted a couple of her fellow organizers, wandering in late. Nearby, Bland’s infant daughter, Chloe, born just after the election, began wailing.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="142"><!-- react-text: 143 -->“I couldn’t get it together this morning to have her at home,” announced Bland, her red hair tied up in Harajuku-style double topknots. “So I just brought her along.” Later, Sarsour, in her mid-30s and the mother of three teenagers, would go over and use a baby blanket to swaddle the crying newborn tightly into what the activist called “a cigar” as a couple other women looked on admiringly. It takes a village, I thought to myself.<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="ad __no-background" data-reactid="144"><div class="ad--inner" data-cns="intext_first_page_3" id="" data-reactid="145"></div></div><p data-reactid="146"><!-- react-text: 147 -->But that impression of cozy familiarity was not the whole picture. The day of our shoot, I later learned, was only the second time that this particular group of women had ever been in the same room. Some members of the team had worked together before: Sarsour and two of her fellow national cochairs, Tamika D. Mallory, an African-American civil rights activist and gun control advocate, and Carmen Perez, executive director of Harry Belafonte’s Gathering for Justice, had collaborated on previous marches against police brutality, for example. But many of these women were newly acquainted strangers who communicated mostly by email and phone. “I’m not going to lie to you,” Sarsour said. “When I started this process, more than half the women I’d never met in my life.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="148"><!-- react-text: 149 -->“It’s a bunch of people who have no idea who each other is, creating something massive,” Vanessa Wruble, in charge of campaign operations, added later. “If you think about how hard it is to trust people normally, on a day-to-day basis,” she said, “try to do that within the span of a month and a half.” The activist smiled, in some mélange of frustration and awe, and gave her head a little shake.<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="image-embed" data-reactid="150"><picture data-reactid="151"><source media="(min-width: 960px)" srcset="http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58912a89fb0604bf1f5c13c0/master/w_660,c_limit/02_Womens_March_Organizers.jpg, http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58912a89fb0604bf1f5c13c0/master/w_1320,c_limit/02_Womens_March_Organizers.jpg 2x" data-reactid="152"/><source media="(min-width: 760px)" srcset="http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58912a89fb0604bf1f5c13c0/master/w_690,c_limit/02_Womens_March_Organizers.jpg, http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58912a89fb0604bf1f5c13c0/master/w_1380,c_limit/02_Womens_March_Organizers.jpg 2x" data-reactid="153"/><source media="(min-width: 450px)" srcset="http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58912a89fb0604bf1f5c13c0/master/w_720,c_limit/02_Womens_March_Organizers.jpg, http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58912a89fb0604bf1f5c13c0/master/w_1440,c_limit/02_Womens_March_Organizers.jpg 2x" data-reactid="154"/><source srcset="http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58912a89fb0604bf1f5c13c0/master/w_410,c_limit/02_Womens_March_Organizers.jpg, http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58912a89fb0604bf1f5c13c0/master/w_820,c_limit/02_Womens_March_Organizers.jpg 2x" data-reactid="155"/><img class="image-embed--image" srcset="http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58912a89fb0604bf1f5c13c0/master/w_410,c_limit/02_Womens_March_Organizers.jpg" data-reactid="156"/></picture><div class="article-image--meta" data-reactid="157"><div class="meta--copy" data-reactid="158"><span class="meta--slide-caption" data-reactid="159"><!-- react-text: 160 -->Left to right: Nantasha Williams, Breanne Butler, Ting Ting Cheng, Ginny Suss, Bob Bland, Janaye Ingram, Paola Mendoza, Carmen Perez, Sarah Sophie Flicker, Tamika Mallory, Tabitha St. Bernard<!-- /react-text --></span><span class="meta--slide-credit" data-reactid="161"><!-- react-text: 162 -->Photographed by Cass Bird | Sittings Editor: Jorden Bickham<!-- /react-text --></span></div><div class="social-sharer social-sharer__article-image" data-reactid="163"><ul class="social-sharer--share-links" data-reactid="164"><li class="facebook share-links--link analytics--target__article-image" data-reactid="165"><a media="true" class="link--anchor icon-facebook" data-reactid="166"></a></li><li class="pinterest share-links--link analytics--target__article-image" data-reactid="167"><a media="true" class="link--anchor icon-pinterest" data-reactid="168"></a></li></ul></div></div></div><p data-reactid="169"><!-- react-text: 170 -->The story of how the Women’s March on Washington came into being has already been codified into lore. As the returns rolled in on November 8, a Hawaiian grandmother and retired attorney named Teresa Shook created a Facebook page suggesting that women gather to protest in D.C. on inauguration weekend. Then she went to bed. By the time she woke up, 10,000 people had affirmed the plan.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="171"><!-- react-text: 172 -->Simultaneously, Bland, founder of the fashion incubator Manufacture New York and an advocate for domestic manufacturing, had a similar idea. She also posted about it on Facebook, where her followership had ballooned after she raised $20,000 for Planned Parenthood by selling <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="173"><!-- react-text: 174 -->Nasty Woman<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 175 --> and <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="176"><!-- react-text: 177 -->Bad<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 178 --> <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="179"><!-- react-text: 180 -->Hombre<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 181 --> T-shirts. “We need to form a resistance movement that’s about what is positive,” she remembered thinking. “Something that will help empower us to wake up in the morning and feel that women still matter.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="182"><!-- react-text: 183 -->It wasn’t long before Shook and Bland caught wind of each other and consolidated their efforts. Soon Wruble became aware of their plan. In her real life she runs Okayafrica, a media platform seeking to change Western perceptions of Africa that she cofounded with her business partner, Ginny Suss (also the march&#x27;s production director) and The Roots drummer Questlove. Having worked for years as a white person in a black space, Wruble quickly recognized that Shook and Bland, both white, could not be the sole faces of the protest they were starting to organize. “I think I wrote, ‘You need to make sure this is led or centered around women of color, or it will be a bunch of white women marching on Washington,’” she paraphrased. “‘That’s not okay right now, especially after 53 percent of white women who voted, voted for Donald Trump.’”<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="ad __no-background" data-reactid="184"><div class="ad--inner" data-cns="intext_first_page_4" id="" data-reactid="185"></div></div><p data-reactid="186"><!-- react-text: 187 -->Bland agreed, and Wruble reached out to a friend, activist Michael Skolnik, who recommended she and Bland talk to Mallory and Perez. The latter two activists brought Sarsour to the table shortly thereafter.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="188"><!-- react-text: 189 -->Somewhere in there, controversy bloomed over the name Shook had floated: the Million Women March, which threatened to overwrite the history of a same-name protest by thousands of African-American women in Philadelphia in 1997. It was Wruble who proposed that they call it the Women’s March on Washington instead, locating their protest in direct lineage with the 1963 March on Washington, the occasion for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="190"><!-- react-text: 191 -->The new coordinators even reached out to the civil rights leader’s daughter, Bernice King, who offered her blessing and shared with them a quote from her mother, Coretta Scott King. Perez read it to me when we followed up by phone a couple weeks after the shoot: “Women, if the soul of the nation is to be saved, I believe that you must become its soul.’”<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="ad __no-background" data-reactid="192"><div class="ad--inner" data-cns="intext_first_page_5" id="" data-reactid="193"></div></div><p data-reactid="194"><!-- react-text: 195 -->“It gave us all chills,” she remembered. “It assured us that we were moving in the right direction.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="196"><!-- react-text: 197 -->What I think she meant is this: Where past waves of feminism, led principally by white women, have focused predominantly on a few familiar concerns—equal pay, reproductive rights—this movement, led by a majority of women of color, aspires to be truly intersectional. So though the Women’s March has partnered with organizations like Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America—and though second-wave feminist icon Gloria Steinem is now an honorary cochair—the march’s purview is far more sweeping. Women are not a monolith, solely defined by gender; we are diverse, we represent half of this country, and any social justice movement—for the rights of immigrants, Muslims, African-Americans, the LGBTQ community, for law enforcement accountability, for gun control, for environmental justice—should count as a “women’s issue.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="198"><!-- react-text: 199 -->If you’re a woman in America, you probably feel personally affected by at least a couple of those struggles. “Women are Muslims,” Sarsour offered. “Women could be black Muslims. Women could be black Muslims and African and undocumented.” Personally, she said, she might care about immigration, “but I also understand that if I don’t have a planet to live on in 30 years, my civil liberties are quite moot.”<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="ad __no-background" data-reactid="200"><div class="ad--inner" data-cns="intext_first_page_6" id="" data-reactid="201"></div></div><p data-reactid="202"><!-- react-text: 203 -->“Yes, it’s about feminism,” Wruble elaborated. “But it’s about more than that: It’s about basic equality for all people.” Women’s rights, in other words, are human rights, a turn of phrase that march leaders, several of them self-identified Bernie Sanders supporters, have reclaimed from a 1995 speech by Hillary Clinton. And if you believe Coretta Scott King (and can look past the results of the presidential election), where women lead, men will eventually follow.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="204"><!-- react-text: 205 -->“I think it has been the downfall of the progressive movement in the United States,” Sarsour told me, “that we have not figured out how to organize all the different progressive social justice movements into one intersectional movement.” Pluralism is a sacred principle. Identity politics is important, but so is winning elections: What makes a pluralistic electorate, with its deep rifts, its tensions, its conflicting agendas, cohere into an actual voting block? If the women behind the march pull this off on the scale they’re hoping for, their success at communicating a message that resonates with a wide array of communities, that activates the formerly politically complacent across racial and cultural lines, could offer a blueprint to the flailing Democratic Party.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="206"><!-- react-text: 207 -->Those may be the unspoken stakes, but the organizers are insistent that the march be treated as a nonpartisan protest. It will surely send a message to Trump, but the coordinators explicitly want to leave his name out of it. “He’s a narcissist,” Sarsour pointed out. “He wants us to make this all about him.”<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="ad __no-background" data-reactid="208"><div class="ad--inner" data-cns="intext_first_page_7" id="" data-reactid="209"></div></div><p data-reactid="210"><!-- react-text: 211 -->It’s bigger than him. “Racism, misogyny is in the fabric of this country,” insisted Perez. “I think Trump was just an individual who was able to ignite a spark, awaken a sleeping giant.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="212"><!-- react-text: 213 -->She meant the racist, misogynistic minority of voters who tipped the balance in the president-elect’s favor (along with those who looked the other way so that they could cling to his promises of simple fixes to complex problems). But I couldn’t help but think that the sleeping giant might also refer to the masses of women who seem suddenly eager to get political in the face of a president who offends and frightens them to their core, the women who, after a long campaign cycle in which they saw their candidate forced into a perpetual defensive crouch, would like to mobilize <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="214"><!-- react-text: 215 -->for<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 216 --> something and not just against something.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="217"><!-- react-text: 218 -->“This is absolutely not just about us having a symbolic march in Washington and that’s it,” said Bland. “It can’t be that way. We’ve helped facilitate the self-activation of so many people. Because when you think about it, especially those first 48 hours when people were just saying, ‘Yes, yes, yes’—that’s them self-selecting into a movement. When we get together, who knows what we can do.”<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="ad __no-background" data-reactid="219"><div class="ad--inner" data-cns="intext_first_page_8" id="" data-reactid="220"></div></div><p data-reactid="221"><!-- react-text: 222 -->Mallory, who grew up in the projects of Harlem in the &#x27;90s, in a family directly affected by Bill Clinton’s omnibus crime bill, who has spent the past two decades on the front lines fighting for her community’s civil rights, shared a slightly more cynical, world-weary view. “Maybe it took your own pain to realize that we’re all bound up in this thing together,” she said. “For me, success for this march doesn’t happen on January 21. It happens after.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="223"><!-- react-text: 224 -->You’ve probably already guessed: All has not been seamless or simple in the organization of the march. Many of its leaders were quick to speak to how difficult it has been to align so many different agendas into a single movement. “We never shy away from history, from the difficulty of where this started,” I was told by Paola Mendoza, a Colombia-born filmmaker serving as artistic director for the rally portion of the program. (She and Suss are wrangling high-profile talent like actress America Ferrera, who is chairing a group called the Artist Table that includes, among others, Scarlett Johansson, Margo Jefferson, Frances McDormand, Amy Schumer, and Zendaya.)<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="225"><!-- react-text: 226 -->“It goes to show how inclusive we’re trying to make this movement,” Mendoza said. Muddling through differences of opinion and experience has required what Perez referred to as “real, courageous conversations”; what Wruble called “really uncomfortable discussions.” (For more on that dialog, check out this piece from the <!-- /react-text --><a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/us/womens-march-on-washington-opens-contentious-dialogues-about-race.html" data-reactid="227"><em data-reactid="228"><!-- react-text: 229 -->New York Times<!-- /react-text --></em></a><!-- react-text: 230 -->about the tensions that permeate the march at every level).<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="ad __no-background" data-reactid="231"><div class="ad--inner" data-cns="intext_first_page_9" id="" data-reactid="232"></div></div><p data-reactid="233"><!-- react-text: 234 -->Mallory told me that the friction came as no surprise. “There’s always conflict, even when all black folks are organizing,” she said. “Because it’s discussions that people shy away from. They don’t want to talk about issues of race, of white privilege. It’s, ‘Woo! Why do we have to talk about that?’ There are those, particularly in this movement, who want to have an ‘all women matter’ conversation. Our position”—and by this, I assumed she was speaking for her community, not for all her fellow organizers—“is that all women do matter. But black women are particularly suffering. And therefore the black women’s voices will be heard. Not just heard, but leading the charge.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="235"><!-- react-text: 236 -->Any internecine struggles were well below the surface on the day of the shoot, where I watched this loose confederation of women, dressed in a uniform of black jeans and crisp white shirts, goofing off on set as they awaited further instructions.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="237"><!-- react-text: 238 -->The women were getting a little cabin-feverish after a long day of waiting around. Music played on the sound system, girl power anthems like Diana Ross’s disco hit “I’m Coming Out.” Wruble danced with Nantasha Williams, a 28-year-old from Queens who’d recently lost her run for New York State Assembly and was now volunteering as Mallory’s right-hand woman. Several women took selfies. Perez emerged from a makeshift changing area in a sharply tailored black coat. “Okay, Neo!” crowed Janaye Ingram, the woman in charge of on-the-ground logistics.<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="ad __no-background" data-reactid="239"><div class="ad--inner" data-cns="intext_first_page_10" id="" data-reactid="240"></div></div><p data-reactid="241"><!-- react-text: 242 -->Earlier, Sarsour had pointed Ingram out to me as “the poor lady who had to get asked about the permit,” referring to a series of news stories speculating that the organizers had either failed to apply for the correct clearances or might yet be rejected by federal agencies. Those concerns have been allayed, and per Ingram, the permits were never actually in doubt—the hubbub surrounding them had been an annoying distraction. Perez later pointed out the underlying sexism at play in the media: “Was Dr. King being asked if he had a permit?” she asked. “Is it because we’re women, and people think we’re incapable of organizing and mobilizing such a major event?”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="243"><!-- react-text: 244 -->Bird was ready to shoot. She instructed her subjects to arrange themselves in two rows. “The back goes high,” she said, “and the front goes low.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="245"><!-- react-text: 246 -->“When they go low, we go high,” Ingram quipped, quoting the line from Michelle Obama’s rousing DNC speech that became Hillary Clinton’s rallying cry. But when Bird started snapping photos, the women of the Women’s March channeled a different woman’s words. Fists raised, they followed Perez in a call and response chant cribbed from Assata Shakur, the Black Liberation Army member controversially convicted of murder in the &#x27;70s, who escaped prison and has lived for decades in exile in Cuba. “It is our duty to fight for our freedom,” Perez shouted, the rest of the group echoing her. “It is our duty to win.

It was bitterly cold, and pedestrians were few and far between, but those who scurried by did a double take.

And that, at least for a few crucial moments, seemed to do the trick: Fourteen individuals melted into a single organism. Bird glided backward, finger on the shutter. And the women of the Women’s March lurched forward, in tenuous formation, as one.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="267"><em data-reactid="268"><!-- react-text: 269 -->Set Design: Nick des Jardins<!-- /react-text --><br data-reactid="270"/><!-- react-text: 271 -->Hair by Ilker Akyol and Makeup by Mariko Arai<!-- /react-text --></em></p><div class="embed cneplaylist-embed-component " data-url="embedjs/58d30061b57ac36f19000034/playlist/56be30deff2afb50ef000026.js?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1&amp;theme=light" data-type="cneplaylist" data-reactid="272"><div data-reactid="273"></div></div></div><div class="article-tags" data-reactid="274"><span class="article-tags--label" data-reactid="275">In This Story:</span><a class="article-tags--link" href="http://www.vogue.com/tag/misc/politics/" data-reactid="276">Politics</a></div><div class="social-sharer social-sharer__post-article" data-reactid="277"><ul class="social-sharer--share-links" data-reactid="278"><li class="facebook share-links--link analytics--target__post-article" data-reactid="279"><a media="true" class="link--anchor icon-facebook" data-reactid="280"></a></li><li class="twitter share-links--link analytics--target__post-article" data-reactid="281"><a media="true" class="link--anchor icon-twitter" data-reactid="282"></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="multi-story-outbrain-wrapper" data-reactid="283"><article class="multi-story multi-story__related met-gala-cta" data-reactid="284"><a href="/tag/event/met-gala" data-reactid="285"><div class="met-gala-cta--content-container" data-reactid="286"><div class="met-gala-cta--image" data-reactid="287"><picture data-reactid="288"><source media="(min-width: 960px)" srcset="http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/02/rfy_override_720.jpg, http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/02/rfy_override_720.jpg 2x" data-reactid="289"/><source media="(min-width: 760px)" srcset="http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/02/rfy_override_720.jpg, http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/02/rfy_override_720.jpg 2x" data-reactid="290"/><source media="(min-width: 450px)" srcset="http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/02/rfy_override_720.jpg, http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/02/rfy_override_720.jpg 2x" data-reactid="291"/><source srcset="http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/02/rfy_override_720.jpg, http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/02/rfy_override_720.jpg 2x" data-reactid="292"/><img class="picture-img" srcset="http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/02/rfy_override_720.jpg" data-reactid="293"/></picture></div><div class="met-gala-cta--content" data-reactid="294"><h3 class="met-gala-cta--title" data-reactid="295">Don’t Miss a Met Gala Moment</h3><p class="met-gala-cta--description" data-reactid="296">The Met Gala is the Oscars of fashion, and we want to make sure you don’t miss a moment—or a dress.

very cold New York City morning just before Christmas, a group of women showed up to have their picture taken by photographer Cass Bird at a warehouse turned studio in the South Bronx neighborhood of Hunts Point, a chunky little peninsula that reaches out into the East River toward Rikers Island.\n\nThose who made the trek were among those responsible for organizing the Women’s March on Washington, a mass mobilization of activists and protestors that will descend on the capital on January 21, the day after we inaugurate into office a man who ran the most brazenly misogynistic presidential campaign in recent history, and whose victory has emboldened a Republican-led Congress to wage an epic war on women’s rights.\n\nPerhaps you’re planning to be there? Perhaps you’re bringing your mother, your grandmother, your daughter, your sister? You’ll be in good company. Per the event’s Facebook page at press time, 176,000 people are planning to attend, with another 250,000 still on the fence. It seems likely, said Linda Sarsour, one of four national cochairs acting as spokeswomen for the movement, that it will be “the largest mass mobilization that any new administration has seen on its first day.”\n\nAhead of our shoot, emails flew back and forth about just how many organizers we could expect to show for the portrait. First it was 10. Then 15. Fourteen women materialized, but several of them informed me that it might have been more like 20.\n\nThat fluidity says something about the Women’s March and how it functions; it’s an organic, grassroots effort that prides itself on being inclusive, intersectional, and nonhierarchical, on taking what Bob Bland (one of the movement’s cofounders, now serving as a national cochair) called “a horizontal approach to leadership.”\n\nIt’s also an all-hands-on-deck, eleventh-hour, race-to-the-finish-line kind of endeavor, which has required all 10, or 15, or 16, or 20 of its chief orchestrators to work around the clock since the week of the election. This is the type of national effort that the group’s communications czar, Cassady Fendlay, told me could take “six months to a year to plan.” These women had just over two months to pull it off.\n\n“We don’t sleep much, as you can probably tell from all our faces,” Sarsour said drily, her own face framed by a fuchsia head scarf. She’s Brooklyn born and bred (with the accent to prove it), the Muslim daughter of Palestinian immigrants, and a veteran activist who heads up the march’s fundraising efforts. She juggles that with, among other things, her job as executive director of the Arab American Association of New York.\n\nSarsour was sitting with me during a bit of downtime before the shoot. “Hey, sweetie; hey, sweetie,” she greeted a couple of her fellow organizers, wandering in late. Nearby, Bland’s infant daughter, Chloe, born just after the election, began wailing.\n\n“I couldn’t get it together this morning to have her at home,” announced Bland, her red hair tied up in Harajuku-style double topknots. “So I just brought her along.” Later, Sarsour, in her mid-30s and the mother of three teenagers, would go over and use a baby blanket to swaddle the crying newborn tightly into what the activist called “a cigar” as a couple other women looked on admiringly. It takes a village, I thought to myself.\n\nBut that impression of cozy familiarity was not the whole picture. The day of our shoot, I later learned, was only the second time that this particular group of women had ever been in the same room. Some members of the team had worked together before: Sarsour and two of her fellow national cochairs, Tamika D. Mallory, an African-American civil rights activist and gun control advocate, and Carmen Perez, executive director of Harry Belafonte’s Gathering for Justice, had collaborated on previous marches against police brutality, for example. But many of these women were newly acquainted strangers who communicated mostly by email and phone. “I’m not going to lie to you,” Sarsour said. “When I started this process, more than half the women I’d never met in my life.”\n\n“It’s a bunch of people who have no idea who each other is, creating something massive,” Vanessa Wruble, in charge of campaign operations, added later. “If you think about how hard it is to trust people normally, on a day-to-day basis,” she said, “try to do that within the span of a month and a half.” The activist smiled, in some mélange of frustration and awe, and gave her head a little shake.\n\n[#image: /photos/58912a89fb0604bf1f5c13c0]||||||\n\n\nThe story of how the Women’s March on Washington came into being has already been codified into lore. As the returns rolled in on November 8, a Hawaiian grandmother and retired attorney named Teresa Shook created a Facebook page suggesting that women gather to protest in D.C. on inauguration weekend. Then she went to bed. By the time she woke up, 10,000 people had affirmed the plan.\n\nSimultaneously, Bland, founder of the fashion incubator Manufacture New York and an advocate for domestic manufacturing, had a similar idea. She also posted about it on Facebook, where her followership had ballooned after she raised $20,000 for Planned Parenthood by selling _Nasty Woman_ and _Bad_ _Hombre_ T-shirts. “We need to form a resistance movement that’s about what is positive,” she remembered thinking. “Something that will help empower us to wake up in the morning and feel that women still matter.”\n\nIt wasn’t long before Shook and Bland caught wind of each other and consolidated their efforts. Soon Wruble became aware of their plan. In her real life she runs Okayafrica, a media platform seeking to change Western perceptions of Africa that she cofounded with her business partner, Ginny Suss (also the march's production director) and The Roots drummer Questlove. Having worked for years as a white person in a black space, Wruble quickly recognized that Shook and Bland, both white, could not be the sole faces of the protest they were starting to organize. “I think I wrote, ‘You need to make sure this is led or centered around women of color, or it will be a bunch of white women marching on Washington,’” she paraphrased. “‘That’s not okay right now, especially after 53 percent of white women who voted, voted for Donald Trump.’”\n\nBland agreed, and Wruble reached out to a friend, activist Michael Skolnik, who recommended she and Bland talk to Mallory and Perez. The latter two activists brought Sarsour to the table shortly thereafter.\n\nSomewhere in there, controversy bloomed over the name Shook had floated: the Million Women March, which threatened to overwrite the history of a same-name protest by thousands of African-American women in Philadelphia in 1997. It was Wruble who proposed that they call it the Women’s March on Washington instead, locating their protest in direct lineage with the 1963 March on Washington, the occasion for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech.\n\nThe new coordinators even reached out to the civil rights leader’s daughter, Bernice King, who offered her blessing and shared with them a quote from her mother, Coretta Scott King. Perez read it to me when we followed up by phone a couple weeks after the shoot: “Women, if the soul of the nation is to be saved, I believe that you must become its soul.’”\n\n“It gave us all chills,” she remembered. “It assured us that we were moving in the right direction.”\n\nWhat I think she meant is this: Where past waves of feminism, led principally by white women, have focused predominantly on a few familiar concerns—equal pay, reproductive rights—this movement, led by a majority of women of color, aspires to be truly intersectional. So though the Women’s March has partnered with organizations like Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America—and though second-wave feminist icon Gloria Steinem is now an honorary cochair—the march’s purview is far more sweeping. Women are not a monolith, solely defined by gender; we are diverse, we represent half of this country, and any social justice movement—for the rights of immigrants, Muslims, African-Americans, the LGBTQ community, for law enforcement accountability, for gun control, for environmental justice—should count as a “women’s issue.”\n\nIf you’re a woman in America, you probably feel personally affected by at least a couple of those struggles. “Women are Muslims,” Sarsour offered. “Women could be black Muslims. Women could be black Muslims and African and undocumented.” Personally, she said, she might care about immigration, “but I also understand that if I don’t have a planet to live on in 30 years, my civil liberties are quite moot.”\n\n“Yes, it’s about feminism,” Wruble elaborated. “But it’s about more than that: It’s about basic equality for all people.” Women’s rights, in other words, are human rights, a turn of phrase that march leaders, several of them self-identified Bernie Sanders supporters, have reclaimed from a 1995 speech by Hillary Clinton. And if you believe Coretta Scott King (and can look past the results of the presidential election), where women lead, men will eventually follow.\n\n“I think it has been the downfall of the progressive movement in the United States,” Sarsour told me, “that we have not figured out how to organize all the different progressive social justice movements into one intersectional movement.” Pluralism is a sacred principle. Identity politics is important, but so is winning elections: What makes a pluralistic electorate, with its deep rifts, its tensions, its conflicting agendas, cohere into an actual voting block? If the women behind the march pull this off on the scale they’re hoping for, their success at communicating a message that resonates with a wide array of communities, that activates the formerly politically complacent across racial and cultural lines, could offer a blueprint to the flailing Democratic Party.\n\nThose may be the unspoken stakes, but the organizers are insistent that the march be treated as a nonpartisan protest. It will surely send a message to Trump, but the coordinators explicitly want to leave his name out of it. “He’s a narcissist,” Sarsour pointed out. “He wants us to make this all about him.”\n\nIt’s bigger than him. “Racism, misogyny is in the fabric of this country,” insisted Perez. “I think Trump was just an individual who was able to ignite a spark, awaken a sleeping giant.”\n\nShe meant the racist, misogynistic minority of voters who tipped the balance in the president-elect’s favor (along with those who looked the other way so that they could cling to his promises of simple fixes to complex problems). But I couldn’t help but think that the sleeping giant might also refer to the masses of women who seem suddenly eager to get political in the face of a president who offends and frightens them to their core, the women who, after a long campaign cycle in which they saw their candidate forced into a perpetual defensive crouch, would like to mobilize _for_ something and not just against something.\n\n“This is absolutely not just about us having a symbolic march in Washington and that’s it,” said Bland. “It can’t be that way. We’ve helped facilitate the self-activation of so many people. Because when you think about it, especially those first 48 hours when people were just saying, ‘Yes, yes, yes’—that’s them self-selecting into a movement. When we get together, who knows what we can do.”\n\nMallory, who grew up in the projects of Harlem in the '90s, in a family directly affected by Bill Clinton’s omnibus crime bill, who has spent the past two decades on the front lines fighting for her community’s civil rights, shared a slightly more cynical, world-weary view. “Maybe it took your own pain to realize that we’re all bound up in this thing together,” she said. “For me, success for this march doesn’t happen on January 21. It happens after.”\n\nYou’ve probably already guessed: All has not been seamless or simple in the organization of the march. Many of its leaders were quick to speak to how difficult it has been to align so many different agendas into a single movement. “We never shy away from history, from the difficulty of where this started,” I was told by Paola Mendoza, a Colombia-born filmmaker serving as artistic director for the rally portion of the program. (She and Suss are wrangling high-profile talent like actress America Ferrera, who is chairing a group called the Artist Table that includes, among others, Scarlett Johansson, Margo Jefferson, Frances McDormand, Amy Schumer, and Zendaya.)\n\n“It goes to show how inclusive we’re trying to make this movement,” Mendoza said. Muddling through differences of opinion and experience has required what Perez referred to as “real, courageous conversations”; what Wruble called “really uncomfortable discussions.” (For more on that dialog, check out this piece from the [_New York Times_](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/us/womens-march-on-washington-opens-contentious-dialogues-about-race.html)about the tensions that permeate the march at every level).\n\nMallory told me that the friction came as no surprise. “There’s always conflict, even when all black folks are organizing,” she said. “Because it’s discussions that people shy away from. They don’t want to talk about issues of race, of white privilege. It’s, ‘Woo! Why do we have to talk about that?’ There are those, particularly in this movement, who want to have an ‘all women matter’ conversation. Our position”—and by this, I assumed she was speaking for her community, not for all her fellow organizers—“is that all women do matter. But black women are particularly suffering. And therefore the black women’s voices will be heard. Not just heard, but leading the charge.”\n\nAny internecine struggles were well below the surface on the day of the shoot, where I watched this loose confederation of women, dressed in a uniform of black jeans and crisp white shirts, goofing off on set as they awaited further instructions.\n\nThe women were getting a little cabin-feverish after a long day of waiting around. Music played on the sound system, girl power anthems like Diana Ross’s disco hit “I’m Coming Out.” Wruble danced with Nantasha Williams, a 28-year-old from Queens who’d recently lost her run for New York State Assembly and was now volunteering as Mallory’s right-hand woman. Several women took selfies. Perez emerged from a makeshift changing area in a sharply tailored black coat. “Okay, Neo!” crowed Janaye Ingram, the woman in charge of on-the-ground logistics.\n\nEarlier, Sarsour had pointed Ingram out to me as “the poor lady who had to get asked about the permit,” referring to a series of news stories speculating that the organizers had either failed to apply for the correct clearances or might yet be rejected by federal agencies. Those concerns have been allayed, and per Ingram, the permits were never actually in doubt—the hubbub surrounding them had been an annoying distraction. Perez later pointed out the underlying sexism at play in the media: “Was Dr. King being asked if he had a permit?” she asked. “Is it because we’re women, and people think we’re incapable of organizing and mobilizing such a major event?”\n\nBird was ready to shoot. She instructed her subjects to arrange themselves in two rows. “The back goes high,” she said, “and the front goes low.”\n\n“When they go low, we go high,” Ingram quipped, quoting the line from Michelle Obama’s rousing DNC speech that became Hillary Clinton’s rallying cry. But when Bird started snapping photos, the women of the Women’s March channeled a different woman’s words. Fists raised, they followed Perez in a call and response chant cribbed from Assata Shakur, the Black Liberation Army member controversially convicted of murder in the '70s, who escaped prison and has lived for decades in exile in Cuba. “It is our duty to fight for our freedom,” Perez shouted, the rest of the group echoing her. “It is our duty to win. We must love and protect one another. We have nothing to lose but our chains!”\n\nLater, the women put on coats—a mismatched assortment in shades of purple [inspired by the suffragists](http://www.vogue.com/13501315/hillary-clinton-concession-speech-purple-suit/)—and assembled outside in the middle of Lafayette Avenue. It was bitterly cold, and pedestrians were few and far between, but those who scurried by did a double take. A couple cars crept up and honked at the road-blockers, and the activists, _Wayne’s World_–style, cleared the way.\n\nDuring a long pause in traffic, they returned to the middle of the street, arranged themselves in a semicircle, and began stalking toward Bird as she walked backward, camera raised. But each woman moved at her own pace and within seconds the “u” had become a squiggly line.\n\nIt suddenly occurred to me that the women in charge of the Women’s March were good at a lot of things, but marching wasn't yet one of them. A photo assistant tried to help. “Right, left, right, left,” he called out. “Too slow!” some of the women retorted.\n\nThen Sarah Sophie Flicker chimed in. An activist with a background in political theater and media production—she worked extensively with the Clinton campaign—she had described her role to me as “trying to fill vacuums and show up where I’m needed.”\n\nHere was a need for her kind of stagecraft, and an illustration of the flexibility of horizontal leadership in action. “The ends go, the middle stays,” Flicker suggested, as the semicircle reconstituted itself for another try. And that, at least for a few crucial moments, seemed to do the trick: Fourteen individuals melted into a single organism. Bird glided backward, finger on the shutter. And the women of the Women’s March lurched forward, in tenuous formation, as one.\n\n_Set Design: Nick des Jardins  \nHair by Ilker Akyol and Makeup by Mariko Arai_\n\n[#cneembed: embedjs/557f3d8761646d1df1160000/playlist/56be30deff2afb50ef000026.js?autoplay=1&muted=1&theme=light]||||||","slug":"meet-the-women-of-the-womens-march-on-washington","photosTout":{"__typename":"Image","url":"http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58936f2fb482c0ea0e4dd1da/master/pass/01_Womens_March_Organizers.jpg","id":"TWVkaWE6NTg5MzZmMmZiNDgyYzBlYTBlNGRkMWRh"},"channels":[{"slug":"culture","id":"VGVybTo1ODRlZWMwMjBkZTdhN2YxNDljYTFhN2Y=","name":"Culture"}],"contentFlags":{"hasLegalDisclaimer":false,"isSponsored":false},"lede":{"__typename":"Image","caption":"Top row (_left to right_): Ting Ting Cheng, Tabitha St. Bernard, Janaye Ingram, Paola Mendoza, Cassady Fendlay, Linda Sarsour, Bob Bland, Nantasha Williams, Breanne Butler, Ginny Suss, Sarah Sophie Flicker.
