<p>How has the third-wave of feminism changed the roles of women in the United States?</p>

<p>According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, feminism is defined as the
theory of the political, economic, and the social equality of the
sexes. The feminist movement, also know as the Women's Liberation
Movement has been an on going battle for the last 100 years. The
history of women has been one of submission. Marriages were once
arranged and women were expected to be obedient to their husbands.
Women didn&#8217;t typically work outside of the home and were expected to
raise children. Mary Wollstonecraft was the first feminist when she
published <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Women</em> in
1792 in which she advocated for the "social and moral equality of
sexes". (Wikipedia). In 1848, the seventy year fight for the women&#8217;s
right to vote began. The Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the
right to vote, was ratified in 1920. This fight for equality was later
termed the &#8220;first-wave of feminism&#8221;. The &#8220;second-wave&#8221; began in the
early 1960&#8217;s and ran through the late 1980&#8217;s. In this wave, women
strived to reach a further sense of equality with men and to allow
women to have a greater control over their body and the protection from
physical abuse.</p>
<p>During World War II, over six million women took an active part in
the work force. They filled positions in factories or working on farms.
Over three million women worked for the Red Cross and over 200,000
women served in the military. At the end of the war, women were laid
off from the positions they had during the war. Women again were thrown
into the life of being a housewife. In 1949, French author and
philosopher, <a href="http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his135/Events/Beauvoir86.htm" target="_blank" title="Simone de Beauvoir">Simone de Beauvoir</a> wrote her book, <em>The Second Sex</em>,
which first depicts women as just another body, not an equal to men.
She explained that there was a hierarchy and that through sterotyping,
women were on a lower level. It also stated that women's had a sense of
"mystery" around them and were depicted as "other". She also went on to
state that this was true in other areas, such as race, class, and
religion, but was prevelant in the way men sterotyped women. It would
be years later before her work would become an inspiration for the
women&#8217;s liberation movement. By the late 1950&#8217;s women were becoming
disgruntled with their place in society and the inability to obtain
employment and achieve equality.</p>
<p>The 1960&#8217;s was a year of change. People became more vocal and
strived for equality among all people. The Food and Drug Administration
approved the first oral contraceptive for women. They were available to
women the following year. This became the first step in the liberation
movement. This now allowed women to take a stand on their reproductive
rights.</p>
<p>In 1961, President Kennedy established the Commission on the Status
of Women to examine issues related to women and to make proposals on
such topics as employment, Social Security, education and tax laws. At
this time, there was a growing interest in women&#8217;s rights. Courts were
also being faced with cases that dealt with the reproductive rights of
women. The commission did find that discriminatory actions were being
taken against women. </p>
<p>In 1963, the Federal Government amended the Equal Rights Act. This
was to ensure that sex-based wage discrimination between men and women
in the same work establishment was prohibited. The following year,
President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This was to
protect women from being discriminated against in the work environment.
In 1965, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioners (EEOC) was
appointed to enforce the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>This; however, was not the case. Women were not being treated fairly
in the workplace and the EEOC was unable to enforce the Civil Rights
Act. So, in June 1966, while attending the Third National Conference on
the Commission on the Status of Women in Washington, D.C., Betty
Friedan and twenty-eight women founded the National Organization for
Women (NOW). The purpose of the organization was &#8220;to take action to
bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American
society now, exercising all privileges and responsibilities thereof in
true equal partnership with men&#8221;.</p>
<p>As the year&#8217;s progressed, NOW&#8217;s membership grew. By the time the
organization was incorporated in 1967, the membership numbers were at
1037. As membership grew, so did the demonstrations, rallies, petitions
and such that were designed to facilitate the spread of information on
the purpose of the group. They boycotted the 1968 Miss America Beauty
Contest in Atlantic City to let it be known that women&#8217;s worth wasn&#8217;t
about their appearance. NOW was readily involved in multiple law suits
against companies that violated a woman&#8217;s right for equal opportunity
employment. </p>
<p>As a result of this hard work and dedication, they were a strong
voice in having the Equal Rights Amendment revisited. It was no longer
about the right to vote, but it became the battle to be recognized as a
citizen and a person. By 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment had been
approved by both houses of Congress and was sent to be ratified by the
states. This was a big step towards women&#8217;s liberation. The National
Organization for Women continued its work for women&#8217;s rights. Task
forces were created in support of the right to an abortion and
protection for victims of rape. New legislation, as a result of court
cases supported by NOW, was presented to protect the victim in a
physical assault case. One such case was that of Joanne Little, in
1975. Ms. Little was in prison on a felony breaking and entering and
larceny. While in prison, she was sexual assaulted by another prisoner
and, in self-defense, killed her attacker. She was acquitted of this
charge which set a precedent for victims of sexual assault.</p>
<p>By the end of 1979, the National Organization for Women&#8217;s membership
numbers was 100,000 members strong. In 2008, NOW has 500,000 members
and 550 chapters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The
organization is still fighting for the rights of women and ensuring
that the organization stays true to the ideals of its founding members.</p>

<li>1949&#8211; Simone de Beauvoir&#8217;s book, The Second Sex, was published in
the United States. The term &#8220;women&#8217;s liberation&#8221; was first used in the
book.</li>
<li>1960 &#8211; The Federal Food and Drug Administration approved birth
control pills. They were available on the market the following year.</li>
<li>1961 &#8211; President Kennedy created the President&#8217;s Commission on the Status of Women chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt.</li>
<li>1963 &#8211; The Equal Pay Act of 1963 was amended. This prohibited
sex-based wage discrimination between men and women in the same
establishment doing similar work.</li>
<li>1963 &#8211; Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique. The book
questioned the belief that woman were happy with their marriages and
with motherhood.</li>
<li>1964 &#8211; The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed by Congress and
signed by President Johnson. This prohibited discrimination in the work
environment based on gender.</li>
<li>1965 - The Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioners (EEOC) were appointed to oversee the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act.</li>
<li>1965 &#8211; President Johnson&#8217;s Executive Order 11246 ordered &#8220;federal
agencies and federal contractor&#8217;s to take &#8216;affirmative action &#8216; in
overcoming employment discrimination&#8221;.</li>
<li>1966 &#8211; Because the EEOC was unable to enforce the Civil Rights Act,
28 women formed the National Organization for Women (NOW). Betty
Friedan was elected the first national president of the Organization at
the founding conference held in Washington D.C.</li>
<li>1967 &#8211; The National Organization for Women was formally incorporated.  Membership was up to 1035.</li>
<li>1968 &#8211; One hundred women protested the Miss America Beauty Pageant
because it promoted &#8220;physical attractiveness and charm as the primary
measure of a woman&#8217;s worth&#8221;. (Sawhney)</li>
<li>1971 &#8211; The initial Equal Rights Amendment (in its original form) passed the House of Representatives.</li>
<li>1972 &#8211; The Equal Rights Amendment passed the Senate and was sent to
be ratified by the states. This was a major victory for women&#8217;s rights
movements.</li>
<li>1973 &#8211; Judge Harry A. Blackmun wrote the decision for Rowe vs. Wade which legalized first trimester abortions.</li>
<li>1973 - NOW&#8217;s Task Force on Rape was formed to redefine rape as a
crime of violence against women and to laws dealing with rape and how
it was handled at trial.</li>
<li>1974 &#8211; The first &#8220;March for Life&#8221; pro-life rally against abortion
took place in Washington D.C. The march was organized by Nellie Gray.</li>
<li>1975 &#8211; Joanne Little was acquitted on the murder Clarence Alligood.
This set a precedent for the rape victim&#8217;s right of self-defense in
sexual assault cases.</li>
<li>1978 &#8211; In August, over 100,000 people marched in Washington D.C. to extend the time limit to ratify the ERA.</li>
<li>1979 &#8211; The National Organization for Women membership was 100,000 members strong.</li>
