Food Not Bombs is one of the fastest growing revolutionary movements active in North America today and is gaining momentum all over the world.  There are over 175 autonomous chapters sharing vegetarian food with hungry people and protesting war and poverty throughout the Americas, Europe and Australia.  The first group was formed in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1980 by anti-nuclear activists.  Food Not Bombs is an all volunteer organization dedicated to nonviolence.  Food Not Bombs has no formal leaders and strives to include everyone in its decision making process.  Each group recovers food that would otherwise be thrown out and makes fresh hot vegetarian meals that are served in city parks to anyone without restriction.  The groups also serve free vegetarian meals at protests and other events.  The San Francisco Chapter has been arrested over 1,000 times in an effort to silence its protest against the Mayor&#39s anti- homeless policies.   Amnesty International states it may adopt those Food Not Bombs volunteers that are imprisoned as &#34Prisoners of Conscience&#34 and will work for their unconditional release.<P>
Food Not Bombs works in coalition with groups like Earth First!, The Leonard Peltier Defense Committee, Anarchist Black Cross, the IWW, Homes Not Jails, Anti Racist Action, In Defense of Animals, the Free Radio Movement and other organizations on the cutting edge of positive social change and resistance to the new global austerity program. One collective publishes a movement wide newsletter called A Food Not Bombs Menu.  There is also a German language Menu.  Food Not Bombs Publishing in Takoma Park, Maryland publishes books like <i>On Conflict and Consensus</i> which has been an important guide for group democracy.  We hope you will join us in taking direct action towards creating a world free from domination, coercion and violence.<BR><BR>
