let

a

let

not

and
pretend
that
the
reason
is
becaus

becaus
that
s
just
a

of
the
overal
problem
that
we
ve

we
are
go
to
have
to
tighten
our
belt
but
we
re
go
to
have
to
do
it
in
an
intellig
way
and
we
ve
got
to
make
sure
that
the
peopl
who
are
help
are
work
american
famili
and
we
re
not
suddenli
say
that
the
way
to
do
thi
is
to
elimin
program
that
help
ordinari
peopl
and
give
more
tax
cut
to

we
tri
that
formula
for

it

amus
over

have

have
these

healthi
skeptic
about

it
wa
not

get

and
he
challeng
the
tea

to
get
specif
about
how
they
would
cut
govern
debt
and
spend
and
so
the
challeng
i
think
for
the
tea

movement
is
to
identifi
specif
what
would
you
do
it
s
not
enough
just
to
say
get
control
of

i
think
it
s
import
for
you
to
say
i
m
will
to
cut
veteran
benefit
or
i
m
will
to
cut
medicar
or

what
you
can

which
is
what
i

hear
a

is
say
we
