they

etc
i
am
not
romantic
the
tribal
lifestyl
but
it
is
much
better
than
what
we
live
in
our
apart
in
iit
also
see
we
are
live
here
in
prime
area
among
deer
etc
on

we
were
chat
with
one
of
our
elder
look
at
the

river
etc
dala
kaka
said
look
at
thi
beauti
scene
my
hous
is
here
my
children
and
grandchildren
are
there
you
will
kick
us
out
of
thi
place
put
us
in
block
and
then
you
will
come
in
maruti
to
enjoy
thi
so
you
will
see
that
no
matter
how
urban
we
may
be
we
attach
so
much
valu
to
thi
even
peopl
in
mumbai
will
tri
to
have
their
own
piec
of
land
90
km
from
mumbai
seren
etc
now
if
we
who
live
in
citi
attach
thi
kind
of
valu
to
thi
land
think
how
much
more
valuabl
it
is
to
those
to
whom
it
ha
belong
from
centuri
but
what
do
we
think
just
like
prime
land
theori
in
urban
area
we
think
thi
prime
land
doe
not
belong
to
them
it
should
belong
to
those
who
have

life
ha
some
other
requir
it
start
from

for

women
cannot

in

we
find
that
thi
is

face

that
wa
not

in

no

no

for

water
no

we
can
also
see
that
90
of

were
satisfi
by
the

the

they

had
look
at
the
place
and
said
oh
thi
is
a
mountain
place
how
can
we
build
the
road
but
if
you
look
at
mahabaleshwar
how
were
those
road
built
road
can
be
built
but
have
you
the
polit
will
to
do
that
except
for
cloth
salt
and
sweetmeat
they
bought
noth
from
the
market
even
now
the
commun
life
is
such
that
one
person
will
go
and
collect
the
loan
of
other
peopl
women
have
more
freedom
than
urban
women
though
i
am
not
say
that
they
are
not
also
oppress
harass
it
is
there
secondli
there
is
no
cast
in
tribal
area
also
hierarchi
is
much
less
you
can
talk
to
your
mla
or
panchay
samiti
in
singular
term
are
karo
re
farmer
in
nimad
had
their
own
resourc
base
they
were
well
develop
in
the
normal
convent
sens
in
nimad
everi
villag
ha
school
dispensari
std
noth
is
backward
as
we
have
the
notion
with
us
but
offici
have
us
believ
that
thi
is
the
backward
area
it
is
entitl
for
submerg
and
whatev
differ
we
make
in
thi
place
that
is
develop
thi
is
not
so
these
are
the
variou
thing
that
are
involv
in
the
displac
in
maharashtra
the
govern
would
not
even
answer
the
rudimentari
question
of
whether
land
for
land
is
avail
mohan
i
appreci
your
statement
about
qualiti
but
could
you
quantifi
the
kind
of
resourc
base
that
a
villag
ha
sanjay
in
1986
87
we
had
done
a
survey
on
these
tribal
villag
the
govern
survey
and
our
survey
differ
on
the
resourc
base
even
the
popul
categori
of
the
oust
affect
peopl
but
i
don
’
t
have
the
figur
with
me
question
you
mention
that
the
villag
have
std
etc
sanjay
ye
some
villag
do
i
mean
if
these
are
the
pointer
of
develop
they
are
also
there
someon
they
are
in
the
plain
sanjay
ye
in
the
plain
that
is
what
i
am
talk
about
it
is
the
fertil
area
everyth
is
there
mara
mari
hai
parti
baju
hai
sab
hai
there
is
polit
parti
everyth
is
there
ravi
and
veri
rich
peopl
are
also
there
sanjay
not
rich
they
are
middl
peasant
5
of
them
are
rich
40
are
middl
peasant
and
everyon
is
in
debt
ravi
i
am
say
that
one
of
the
greatest
resourc
of
the
villag
is
the
soil
which
is
veri
rich
sanjay
ye
it
is
veri
rich
admi
bhi
boya
to
even
if
you
plant
a
man
he
will
grow
these
are
strip
draw
map
of
the
variou
taluka
and
constitu
they
are
not
in
a
posit
to
assert
on
one
constitu
it
is
a
long
line
of
240
km
but
not
a
singl
constitu
depend
on
the
narmada
villag
for
it
vote
in
each
area
the
narrow
strip
of
the
narmada
is
a
small
segment
of
the
popul
prakash
so
what
about
the
villag
bigwig
gabriel
bigwig
will
alway
have
other
option
first
they
may
get
better
resettl
becaus
they
had
more
land
to
begin
with
they
may
have
other
land
elsewher
they
will
alway
have
a
way
out
sanjay
and
there
are
bigwig
who
out
of
convict
are
with
the
movement
just
as
we
who
have
noth
to
do
with
it
are
interest
out
of
convict
thi
wa
a
problem
even
for
the
33
villag
what
about
the
193
well
settl
villag
in
the
plain
thi
displac
is
not
onli
due
to
the
reservoir
177
000
peopl
were
affect
by
the
canal
25
000
are
lose
more
than
90
of
their
land
it
is
the
largest
canal
network
in
the
world
catchment
area
treatment
thi
is
not
mere
forest
land
but
it
is
land
that
tribal
have
been
cultiv
for
gener
govern
treat
them
as
encroach
that
land
will
be
taken
affect
mani
thousand
more
peopl
thi
submerg
of
forest
is
sought
to
be
compens
by
creation
of
a
sanctuari
108
villag
will
be
displac
for
thi
there
are
wave
and
wave
of
displac
nearli
1
million
peopl
will
be
affect
by
the
canal
sanctuari
and
secondari
displac
from
thi
one
dam
thi
did
not
all
becom
evid
in
1
or
2
year
but
as
we
proceed
in
1987
medha
had
seen
one
small
news
item
in
ahmedabad
daili
that
gujarat
minist
wa
blame
mp
minist
for
not
give
the
clearanc
so
it
wa
clear
that
the
minist
of
environ
and
forest
had
not
given
clearanc
so
then
we
began
dig
up
document
so
let
us
see
the
benefit
the
claim
is
that
water
will
reach
drought
prone
area
of
kutch
and
saurashtra
out
of
all
the
cultiv
land
of
kutch
we
will
see
later
if
we
have
time
if
thi
is
realli
drought
prone
or
not
but
if
all
goe
well
there
are
no
engin
delay
etc
even
then
the
canal
will
reach
kutch
onli
in
2025
and
not
all
of
land
either
canal
will
reach
1
8
of
all
the
cultiv
land
of
kutch
and
9
of
all
cultiv
land
in
saurashtra
will
get
canal
in
2020
the
south
central
area
of
gujarat
which
is
the
power
hold
area
just
like
in
orissa
4
district
command
all
the
resourc
will
get
the
major
of
the
water
here
is
a
strong
patel
lobbi
about
drink
water
there
is
to
date
no
plan
and
no
budget
for
provid
the
drink
water
they
are
say
8000
villag
will
get
water
but
ssnnl
is
respons
onli
for
get
the
water
into
the
canal
who
is
go
to
provid
thi
water
the
cost
of
provid
the
drink
water
estim
as
5
7
crore
ha
not
been
allot
in
anyon
’
s
budget
gujarat
sewerag
and
water
board
would
in
principl
be
respons
for
thi
but
ha
not
a
singl
rupe
for
it
nor
doe
it
have
a
plan
about
power
1400
mw
is
the
establish
capac
as
the
canal
is
built
and
the
water
will
go
more
and
more
to
irrig
the
water
for
power
will
decreas
after
the
oper
of
the
dam
within
30
year
the
power
benefit
of
the
dam
will
come
nearli
to
zero
if
the
prioriti
is
irrig
then
we
have
to
do
it
power
will
onli
be
secondari
the
estim
of
water
in
narmada
vari
mp
maintain
that
narmada
ha
not
28
maf
but
onli
22
75
maf
if
water
yield
is
decreas
then
natur
all
the
benefit
must
be
re
evalu
then
anoth
problem
narmada
sagar
must
be
built
befor
ssp
what
if
it
is
not
there
is
an
equal
strong
movement
there
as
254
villag
will
be
affect
if
that
dam
is
not
built
the
power
benefit
will
decreas
by
25
and
irrig
by
30
ok
suppos
narmada
sagar
is
built
and
water
yield
is
all
okay

that

befor
that
we
had

you
must
have
seen
the

narmada
diari
those
who

the
main
thing
is
that

i

a
fashion
word
now
but
human
right
abus
you
cannot
carri

the
greater
violenc
wa
that
the

of

there
is
the
larger
issu
which
gabriel
will
start
with
all
of
thi
is
done
within
the
wider
context
of
develop
from
1989
nba
ha
said
that
our

i

sorri
for

much
rambl
ravi
i
want
to
put
thi

present
in

with

one

aid
mumbai
is
go

do
is
to
have
similar
present
in
variou
univers
of

i
want
to
tell
you
what
aravinda
and
i
found
while
travel
with
the
nba
in
the
past
6
month
and
visit
some
of
these
villag
the
entir
aspect
of
studi
the
environment
impact
statement
engin
feasibl
even
basic
question
like
if
thi
is
the
height
of
the
dam
how
mani
villag
will
be
submerg
which
we
would
expect
the
govern
to
do
ha
been
done
by
activist
we
assum
that
the
govern
or
scientist
or
engin
do
these
thing
but
what
the
govern
wa
suppos
to
do
is
actual
be
done
by
activist
such
as
sanjay
and
other
and
actual
some
of
the
nba
activist
are
iit
graduat
they
have
veri
good
technic
peopl
and
good
legal
help
some
of
the
most
prestigi
lawyer
are
associ
with
nba
my
uncl
who
is
a
physic
professor
in
iitm
wa
also
ask
sanjay
whi
are
you
oppos
the
dam
and
develop
dam
are
necessari
for
variou
purpos
when
sanjay
talk
about
the
variou
studi
and
technic
detail
my
uncl
agre
with
him
and
said
ye
whi
don
’
t
you
fight
on
these
point
but
when
you
go
with
nba
you
will
find
that
thi
is
exactli
the
fight
on
everi
detail
for
exampl
the
govern
agre
to
lower
the
height
of
the
dam
in
bargi
everi
year
in
decemb
thi
will
open
up
some
field
area
where
farmer
can
grow
crop
thi
is
an
agreement
reach
with
the
govern
but
the
govern
never
doe
it
so
these
peopl
have
to
go
there
demand
their
right
and
final
the
govern
open
the
gate
everywher
when
i
talk
to
my
friend
whether
in
the
us
or
in
india
peopl
ask
the
same
question
it
is
so
naïv
that
i
think
are
we
actual
educ
they
summar
the
whole
issu
by
say
oh
these
peopl
are
just
go
on
the
street
tri
to
stop
the
dam
but
isn
’
t
the
dam
good
for
progress
when
you
go
into
the
detail
you
will
find
that
they
do
an
amaz
job
on
all
the
detail
nba
and
napm
should
be
given
total
credit
for
have
made
an
educ
contribut
as
well
as
an
environment
contribut
they
have
put
all
the
issu
on
the
tabl
it
is
becaus
of
them
that
the
govern
peopl
are
to
some
extent

20

you

of

when
you
call

peopl
activist
these
peopl
are
not

they
are
the
real
indian
pleas
do
not
call
them
activist
they
are
the
one
educ
us
to
recogn
what
india
is
about
the
govern
call
then
activist
and
label
them
as
if
they
are
out
to
destroy
india
exactli
the
opposit
is
true
i
suggest
that
we
elimin
the
use
