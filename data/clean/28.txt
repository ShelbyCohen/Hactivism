a
practic
motiv
for

is
relat

the
abil
of

to

situat

it
is
simpli
too
expens
for

cooper
provid
a
method
for
farmer
to
join
togeth

an
associ
through
which
a
group
of
farmer
can
acquir
a
better
outcom
typic
financi
than
by
go
alon
thi
approach
is
align
to
the
concept
of
economi
of
scale
and
can
also
be
relat
as
a
form
of
econom
synergi
where
two
or
more
agent
work
togeth
to
produc
a
result
not
obtain
by
ani
of

it
may
seem
reason
to
conclud
that
larger
the

the
better
thi
is

true
cooper

with
some
cooper

can
have
over
10

while
the

are
a

in

it
is

strength
of
