and

let

the

that
goe
outsid
the
scope
of

free

comput

what
we
do
agre
on
is
the
import
of

the
end
to
which
ani
softwar
can
be

may
be

we
don

defend
the
right
of
anyon
to
use

to
kill

that

restrict

without

express
speech
math
and

are
not
an

thi
is
a
major
reason
whi
we
do
not

common
misunderstand
of
“

and
“
open

”
the
term
“

”
is
prone
to
misinterpret
an
unintend
mean
“
softwar
you
can
get
for
zero

”
fit
the
term
just
as
well
as
the
intend
mean
“
softwar
which
give
the
user
certain
freedom
”
we
address
thi
problem
by
publish
the
definit
of
free
softwar
and
by
say
“
think
of
‘
free

’
not
‘

’”
thi
is
not
a
perfect
solut
it
cannot
complet
elimin
the

an
unambigu

correct

would
be
better
if
it
didn

present
other

unfortun
all
the

have
problem
of
their

we
ve
look
at

that
peopl
have
suggest
but
none
is
so
clearli
“
right
”
that
switch
to
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
instanc
in
some
context
the
french

ha
some
kind
of

—
and
thi
includ
“

”
the
offici
definit
of
“
open

”
which
is
publish
by
the
open

and
is
too
long
to
includ
here
wa
deriv
indirectli
from
our

for

it
is
not
the

it
is
a
littl
looser
in

respect
nonetheless
their

agre
with
our
definit
in
most
case
howev
the
obviou

for
the

“

and
the
one
most
peopl
seem
to
think
it
mean
—
is
“
you
can
look
at

”
that
criterion
is
much
weaker
than
the
free

definit
much
weaker
also
than
the
offici
definit
of
open

it
includ
mani
program
that
are
neither

open
sourc
sinc
the
obviou
mean
for
“

is
not
the
mean
that
it
advoc
intend
the
result
is
that
most
peopl
misunderstand
the

accord
to
writer
neal
stephenson
“

the

by

that
correct
approach
is
less

for

than
it
is
for
us
the
term
“

”
ha
two
natur
mean
one
of
which
is
the

so
a
person
who
ha
grasp
the

will
not

again

the

ha
onli
one
natur

come

difficulti
occasion
is
with
peopl
who
have
been
use
illeg
copi
of
proprietari
softwar
and
do
not
understand
the
need
for
freedom
of
softwar
how
ha
the
free
softwar
movement
grown
in
india
over
the
last
few
year
the
free
softwar
movement
ha
spread
to
almost
all
part
of
the
countri
though
it
ha
realli
grown
strong
onli
in
some
region
at
the
nation
level
we
have
been
abl
to
influenc
the
govern
to
a
reason
extent
i
would
say
that
the
decis
of
the
govern
of
kerala
to
adopt
free
softwar
at
all
level
as
a
polici
ha
help
a
lot
it
serv
to
demonstr
that
it
is
possibl
to
migrat
profit
to
free
softwar
we
are
also
campaign
for
the
adopt
of
open
and
unencumb
standard
for
document
by
the
govern
of
india
do
you
see
free
softwar
both
as
a
movement
and
as
a
philosophi
make
inroad
into
educ
or
govern
in
india
how
much
is
it
understood
at
present
in
my
view
free
softwar
as
a
form
of
softwar
and
as
an
ideolog
is
gain
ground
inexor
and
is
now
virtual
unstopp
it
is
no
longer
a
fring
movement
and
there
is
no
longer
ani
need
to
demonstr
the
feasibl
of
free
softwar
the
work
we
have
to
do
hereaft
is
larg
to
make
peopl
awar
of
thi
possibl
and
it
desir
and
even
the
awar
is
spread
free

is
becom
accept

is
usual
pit
against

how
doe
the

engag
with

i
would
say
that
proprietari
softwar
compani
are
slowli
but
sure
lose
their
grip
on
their

peopl
are
begin

realiz
that

are
not

are
they
alway
the
best
they
are
begin

learn
for

that

are
not
an

that
it
is
the
problem
of
onli
the
oper
system
made
by
one
particular
compani
they
are
also
begin
to
see
that
one
could
use
a
comput
veri
well
without
have
to
pay
more
than
the
cost
of
hardwar
for
just
the
essenti
basic
softwar
admittedli
these
are
pure
practic
consider
but
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
peopl
migrat
to
free

becaus
of
pure
practic
reason
and
later
get
attract
by

philosophi
and
vice

proprietari

compani
have
begun
to
realiz
that
they
are
fight
a

battl
we
find
a
reflect
