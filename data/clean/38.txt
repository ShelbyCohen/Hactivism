so
i
found
a
farmer
klaa
marten
who
wa
grow
incred
wheat
call
emmer
wheat
and
my
goal
at
that
point
—
thi
is
dial
back
about
ten
year
ago
—
wa
to
take
an
ingredi
like
wheat
that
had
thi
sort
of
jaw
droppingli
delici
flavor
and
figur
out
how
it
wa
grown
or
in
the
case
of
a
ham
how
it
wa
rais
and
write
about
that
recip
—
the
recip
befor
it
hit
the
kitchen
—
and
by
way
of
that
recip
talk
about
sustain
and
all
the
principl
of
farm
to
tabl
and
how
to
follow
through
on
that
in
the
context
of
a
restaur
menu
but
i
went
to
klaa
’
s
farm
in
upstat
new
york
to
learn
thi
recip
of
wheat
and
i
wa
stand
in
the
middl
of
a
field
and
all
of
a
sudden
discov
that
he
wa
grow
veri
littl
wheat
and
that
instead
he
wa
grow
a
whole
suit
of
lowli
grain
like
millet
and
buckwheat
and
barley
and
legumin
crop
like
austrian
winter
pea
and
kidney
bean
he
wa
grow
a
lot
of
cover
crop
like
vetch
and
clover
and
they
were
all
veri
meticul
time
and
spread
out
among
the
2
000
acr
that
i
wa
stand
in
the
middl
of
and
that
’
s
when
i
sort
if
had
thi
agricultur
epiphani
but
it
led
to
thi
gastronom
epiphani
which
wa
that
here
i
wa
as
a
farm
to
tabl
chef
wave
the
flag
of
sustain

“
i
realiz
i
need
to
look
at
what
truli
support
the
farm
meant

extend
it
to

”
that
i
wasn
’
t
support
most
of
the
farm
in
the
case
of
klaa
he
need
these
lowli
crop
and
cover
crop
and
legumin
crop
becaus
hi
soil
health
need
it
to
grow
wheat
you
couldn
’
t
get
the
wheat
unless
you
grew
all
these
other
crop
and
you
had
to
time
it
in
thi
way
that
brought
the
fertil
to
the
soil
to
give
you
thi
incred
tast
wheat
so
it
’
s
at
that
moment
i
realiz
i
wa
sort
of
the
emperor
without
ani
cloth
and
i
need
to
look
at
what
truli
support
the
farm
meant
and
extend
it
to
the
menu
how
do
you
chang
the
architectur
of
the
plate
to
reflect
that
kind
of
support
and
i
start
to
realiz
that
a
tradit
menu
especi
a
menu
in
the
western
concept
of
a
smallish
first
cours
follow
by
a
veri
larg
protein
centric
plate
of
food
for
your
main
cours
wa
not
a
way
to
support
the
whole
farm
e360
you
mention
klaa
marten
who
talk
about
“
the
languag
of
the
soil
”
what
kind
of
battl
did
marten
have
to
fight
to
restor
the
health
of
hi
farm
soil
after
year
of
use
chemic
fertil
and
pesticid
barber
he
kind
of
becom
the
hero
figur
in
the
book
he
wa
a
veri
convent
farmer
—
they
call
them
“
nozzlehead
”
who
are
guy
who
spray
problem
away
the
problem
be
pest
fungal
problem
or
wheat
problem
there
’
s
a
differ
cocktail
of
chemic
to
deal
with
each
of
those
problem
and
he
wa
no
differ
and
then
he
wa
as
he
said
poison
one
day
hi
bodi
sort
of
stop
work
he
wa
go
to
lift
a
sprayer
and
he
couldn
’
t
lift
it
and
so
he
start
to
realiz
that
he
wa
be
poison
by
these
chemic
and
he
and
hi
wife
came
that
conclus
by
the
end
of
the
day
and
the
next
day
they
drop
the
“
the
pursuit
of
great
flavor
alway
ha
attach
to
it
great
agricultur
”
chemic
just
like
that
and
they
went
to
organ
so
the
struggl
wa
to
bring
fertil
back
to
the
soil
and
to
do
that
is
i
agre
with
you
it
’
s
a
real
battl
you
’
re
battl
weed
and
pest
and
fungal
diseas
and
all
the
other
thing
that
natur
throw
at
you
in
the
cours
of
a
season
but
the
biggest
struggl
is
to
creat
enough
tilth
and
health
in
your
soil
that
you
can
produc
a
strong
crop
which
mean
you
make
money
off
of
an
acr
and
so
klaa
talk
about
the
languag
of
the
soil
which
is
learn
thi
languag
and
respond
to
what
the
soil
is
tell
you
it
need
to
grow
what
it
need
to
be
fed
in
order
to
grow
these
great
tast
crop
e360
you
talk
about
cover
crop
that
are
need
for
the
health
of
the
soil
and
you
end
up
creat
one
item
on
your
menu
that
support
those
cover
crop
tell
me
about
rotat
risotto
barber
rotat
risotto
came
out
of
that
visit
that
epiphani
in
the
field
here
i
am
the
farm
to
tabl
chef
and
yet
i
’
m
support
onli
the
wheat
crop
which
is
actual
from
a
soil
fertil
perspect
a
veri
expens
crop
it
take
quit
a
bit
of
energi
and
fertil
from
the
soil
and
so
you
need
all
these
other
crop
to
move
around
in
the
meticul
time
way
that
klaa
doe
hi
rotat
to
give
you
the
right
kind
of
soil
health
i
want
to
creat
a
dish
that
celebr
those
rotat
and
didn
’
t
celebr
the
wheat
and
so
rotat
risotto
wa
an
attempt
to
do
that
which
is
to
say
celebr
all
these
uncovet
crop
or
ignor
crop
—
buckwheat
millet
rye
and
cover
crop
too
which
you
can
eat
you
know
cover
crop
and
these
lowli
grain
and
to
a
certain
extent
legumin
crop
they
’
re
all
there
in
hi
marten
’
rotat
to
give
that
soil
health
but
he
lose
money
or
break
even
or
just
make
a
littl
bit
of
money
on
them
becaus
there
’
s
no
market
for
them
either
they
go
into
bagfe
to
feed
anim
—
so
we
do
end
up
eat
all
those
grain
and
other
seed
crop
that
i
mention
in
the
form
of
eat
meat
which
is
a
highli
ineffici
way
to

what
if

start
to

that
’
s
a
true
support
of
a

i
wa
just

in

one
of

said

thought
the

field
the

realli
well
he
said
“
you

the

you

and
then
he
ad
“
thi
is
the
nose

of

”
i
thought
that
wa
a
veri
good
way
to
describ
the

and
your

thought
it

luckili
ye
all

that
’

not

you

that

i

mani
of

have
the
environ
in

when
they

barber
i
’
m
articul
idea
that
the
larger

not

are
practic
”¦
a
chef
may
or
may
not
be
driven
by
the
long
to
support
the
whole

or
the
long
to

but
it
sort
of
doesn

is
what
i
’
ve
realiz
becaus
if
we

lowli
uncovet

the
best

we
are
by

support
the
right

barley

buckwheat
that
tast
truli
delici
have
to
be
grown
in
the
right
kind
of

and
they
have
to
be
the
right
kind
of
seed
and
they
have
to
have
been
rotat
with
other
crop
otherwis
you
don

get
that
flavor
so
the
pursuit
of

by

b
barber
american
agricultur
is
actual
quit
ineffici
in

divers
take
what
the
dehesa
let
’
s
say
the
system
of
agricultur
that
’
s
within

produc
if
you
were
to
compar
the
amount
of

that
wa

on

versu
the
amount
of
corn
that
wa

from
the
dehesa
the
hundr
acr
of

will
in
iowa
will
alway
beat
the
hundr
acr
of
corn
in
a
mix
agricultur
system
but
it
’
s
an
unfair
question
becaus
if
you
were
to
compar
tonnag
the
extremadura
on
a
hundr
acr
produc
a
lot
of
thing
it
produc
barley
it
produc

it
produc
sheep
and
grass
fed
cattl
and
ultim
chees
and
it
ha
oak
that
you
get
cork
for

now
if
you
add
all
that
up
well
a
hundr
acr
in
the
dehesa
far
outstrip
anyth
that
iowa
produc
in
a

acr
—
soy
and
corn
includ
so
the
issu
we
’

realli
talk
about
is
you
have
to
eat
that
divers
otherwis
the
gain
of
all
that
divers
aren
’
t
realiz
so
the
problem
with
the
effici
of
american
agricultur
is
that
we
are
eat
a
ton
of
grain
fed
meat
which
is
where
60
percent
of
that
soy
and
corn
is
go
or
we
’
re
feed
it
to
our
gasolin
tank
so
you
are
produc
a
lot
of
one
thing
—
corn
or
soy
or
if
you
’
re
in
kansa
wheat
or
if
you
’
re
in

tomato
but
that
’
s
not
effici
one
way
to

out
of
thi
is
to
look
at

real
rotat
real

that

the

farmer
i
found
a
guy
name
klaa
marten
from
upstat
new
york
who
grew
emmer
wheat
thi
particular
varieti
of
emmer
wa
at
the
time
nearli
extinct
—
but
klaa
wa
preserv
it
and
he
start
to
suppli
blue
hill
i
bought
a
grinder
for
the
restaur
and
we
ground
klaa
’
s
wheat
mill
it
into
our

flour
and
made

whole
wheat

there
i
wa
walk
the
farm
to
tabl
walk
with
my
organ
heirloom
wheat
basic
mill
to
order
but
befor
long
thing
start
to
get
more
complic
to
support
a
farmer
like
klaa
i
need
to
chang
my
cook
i
need
to
cook
with
the
idea
of
the
whole
farm
in
mind
i
went
back
to
visit
klaa
’
s
farm
think
i
’
d
write
about
him
for
my
book
which
wa
then
in
it
earliest
stage
on
that
visit
i
had
a
second
culinari
epiphani
—
one
that
took
place
not
in
the
kitchen
but
in
the
field
look
out
from
the
middl
of
klaa
’
s
farm
about
2
000
acr
i
realiz
there
wasn
’
t
ani
wheat
—
at
least
not
at
that
time
of
year
i
wa
surround
by
millet
and
oat
and
barley
and
buckwheat
some
mustard
green
some
kidney
bean
—
but
no
wheat
all
these
crop
i
learn
from
klaa
had
veri
specif
function
the
bean
gave
the
soil
nitrogen
and
the
barley
wa
there
to
build
soil
structur
the
mustard
plant
help
cleans
the
soil
of
pathogen
and
diseas
they
were
plant
in
thi
care
time
sequenc
throughout
the
year
all
of
thi
wa
to
prepar
the
soil
to
creat
the
best
possibl
condit
for
that
great
amazingli
flavor
emmer
wheat
klaa
couldn
’
t
grow
hi
healthi
vigor
chemic
free
wheat
without
those
rotat
those
other
crop
in
too
i
rememb
think
oh
my
god
i
’
ve
got
thi
all
wrong
i
d
creat
a
market
for
thi
local
heirloom
emmer
wheat
but
i
wasn
t
do
anyth
to
support
the
entir
system
that
sustain
it
seventi
percent
of
the
crop
support
me
weren
t
even
be
use
they
were
essenti
dump
into
bag
feed
for
anim
at
the
time
there
wasn
’
t
a
local
market
for
buckwheat
for
barley
or
for
millet
or
rye
so
klaa
had
no
altern
he
wa
just
break
even
to
build
up
enough
soil
fertil
for
wheat
and
corn
and
the
stuff
that
could
actual
make
him
money
it
just
struck
me
as
insan
i
realiz
that
to
support
a
farmer
like
klaa
i
need
to
chang
my
cook
i
need
to
cook
with
the
idea
of
the
whole
farm
in
mind
around
that
time
i
read
a
line
from
john
muir
for
the
first
time
—
or
if
not
for
the
first
time
i
read
it
conscious
for
the
first
time
—
that
help
me
articul
what
i
’
d
discov
on
klaa
’
s
farm
“
when
we
tri
to
pick
out
anyth
by
itself
”
he
wrote
“
we
find
it
hitch
to
everyth
els
in
the
univers
”
when
he
wrote
thi
over
a
centuri
ago
of
cours
muir
wasn
’
t
talk
about
agricultur
—
he
wa
refer
to
the
interconnected
of
natur
system
but
the
same
hold
true
for
farm
i
had
come
to
klaa
look
onli
for
the
wheat
but
i
learn
that
in
a
healthi
farm
environ
you
can
’
t
separ
one
crop
from
the
rest
remov
the
barley
say
and
the
qualiti
of
the
soil
will
degrad
to
a
certain
extent
—
eventu
the
wheat
will
chang
too
i
discov
that
you
can
t
look
at
a
great
ingredi
—
a
jaw
drop
delici
flavor
anyth
—
without
understand
the
ecolog
it
came
out
of
in
fact
without
muir
s
quot
i
don
t
know
if
the
full
mean
even
of
the
term
ecolog
—
and
all
the
interrelationship
that
that
word
impli
—
would
ever
have
made
as
much
sens
to
me
i
began
to
rethink
my
relationship
to
food
understand
that
each
isol
ingredi
in
my
kitchen
is
implic
within
a
complex
network
of
relationship
if
i
want
klaa
’
s
wheat
i
should
tri
to
find
a
way
to
support
hi
bean
and
hi
rye
and
hi

green
too
we
talk
about

use
for

cut

well
we
need
nose
to

eat
of
the
whole

we
’
ve
got
to
learn
way
to
give
these
“
undesir

crop
some
mojo
through
realli
creativ
cook
i
made
a
dish
from
klaa
’
s
rotat
crop
call
“
rotat
risotto
”—
it
wa
all
the
crop
that
went
to
support
the
wheat
but
no
wheat
and
no
rice
becaus
he
doesn
’
t
grow
it
it
wa
12
or
13

lowli

—

everyth
to

“

i

these

into
someth
that
resembl
a

not
onli
doe
it
get
peopl
ask
question
—“
what
the
hell
’
s
a
rotat
”—
it
’
s
incred
tasti
and
that
’
s
the
thing
i
didn
t
begin
the
book
with
the
ethic
of
an
environmentalist
or
an
eye
toward
reform
our
food
system
it
wa
selfish
realli
my
explor
wa
motiv
by
my
simpl
and
singl
mind
pursuit
of
great
flavor
each
time
i
wa
driven
out
of
the
restaur
into
the
farm
and
field
it
wa
becaus
i
’
d
tast
someth
so
great
that
i
had
to
learn
more
i
m
a
chef
—
that
s
what
i
m
suppos
to
do
chef
will
do
anyth
to
find
great
flavor
we
are
pitbul
for
flavor
and
that
hedonist
impuls
actual
ha
great
power
ultim
it
can
translat
into
a
chang
landscap
and
even
better
tast
food
if
we
stop
focus
on
grow
individu
product
and
start
tri
to
grow
natur
i
don
’
t
think
the
local
food
movement
as
it
current
stand
ha
the
power
to
chang
our
food
system
in
thi
way
you
cannot
transform
the
landscap
with
a
chef
who
get
excit
about
a
tomato
and
then
decid
to
support
a
local
tomato
farmer
that
’
s
a
good
begin
but
it
’
s
not
enough
becaus
ani
kind
of
good
agricultur
—
especi
organ
agricultur
—
doe
not
allow
you
to
plant
a
lot
of
the
same
crop
without
chemic
or
without
sacrif
plant
health
by
onli
buy
the
tomato
a
chef
doesn
’
t
support
all
the
mani
kind
of
agronom
labor
that
go
into
it
product
we
can
’
t
keep
take
the
cream
of
the
crop
otherwis
we
’
re
ignor
all
the
farmer
’
s
sub
cost
—
essenti
say
“
you
handl
the
pest
and
the
plant
diseas
while
i
deal
with
the
celebr
crop
”
we
think
we
’
ve
done
enough
by
choos
the
covet
item
if
they
’
re
local
if
they
’
re
organ
and
if
we
can
shake
the
hand
of
the
farmer
that
grew
them
—
but
that
’
s
not
enough
the
matur
of
the
local
food
etho
is
a
chef
whose
menu
celebr
tomato
in
their
right
proport
but
also
celebr
their
connect
to
the
whole
—
everyth
that
it
took
to
get
that
soil
readi
to
plant
that
tomato
that
to
me
is
the
awaken
and
i
don
t
think
i
would
have
been
abl
to
see
those
thing
as
clearli
without
the
line
from
muir
one
of
the
thing
that
’
s
amaz
about
hi
idea
is
that
the
circl
keep
widen
the
connect
becom
more
variou
more
beauti
complex
that
s
the
beauti
of
muir
s
line
you
can
spend
a
lifetim
if
you
re
a
good
farmer
or
a
thought
cook
be
surpris
by
the
connect
but
you
can
spend
a
lifetim
ignor
them
too
i
saw
thi
on
anoth
trip
to
klaa
s
farm
mani
year
later
he
had
start
farm
anim
chicken
and
pig
after
the
emmer
wheat
is
harvest
the
pig
go
out
and
forag
on
the
stalk
left
in
the
field
all
of
a
sudden
the
wheat
becom
a
doubl
crop
we
take
the
grain
the
pig
forag
on
the
stalk
and
get
free
feed
and
they
drop
their
manur
in
the
field
as
a
result
the
soil
is
better
prep
for
thi
next
rotat
and
i
realiz
what
s
the
differ
between
support
klaa
’
s
buckwheat
or
barley
and
support
the
pig
i
had
to
support
the
pig
and
i
had
to
buy
klaa
’
s
egg
becaus
the
chicken
were
do
same
thing
on
the
other
grain
they
were
eat
the
discard
grain
for
instanc
grain
that
were
ruin
by
rain
the
day
befor
a
harvest
and
were
not
fit
even
for
sale
as
bag
feed
befor
he
had
chicken
klaa
would
compost
these
grain
now
you
ve
got
a
wast
product
be
fed
to
an
omnivor
creat
thi
unbeliev
delici
end
product
—
essenti
for
free
on
a
more
recent
trip
i
went
up
and
found
that
the
system
had
evolv
even
more
a
malt
facil
open
not
far
from
klaa
’
s
farm
and
whi
did
a
malter
open
becaus
there
s
an
explos
of
microbreweri
in
new
york
state
and
nobodi
can
get
local
barley
malt
becaus
nobodi
s
grow
barley
—
except
for
the
farmer
like
klaa
who
are
use
it
in
their
rotat
now
klaa
make
a
30
percent
profit
sell
hi
barley
to
the
malter
and
as
a
chef
i
’
m
forc
into
make
anoth
connect
to
support
klaa
’
s
wheat
i
need
to
drink
local
beer
my
point
is
that
it
keep
expand
that
s
the
beauti
of
muir
s
line
you
can
spend
a
lifetim
if
you
re
a
good
farmer
or
a
thought
cook
be
surpris
by
the
connect
but
you
can
spend
a
lifetim
ignor
them
too
becaus
the
techniqu
use
in
our
industri
food
system
can
be
character
by
disconnect
a
systemat
unhitch
everyth
is
releg
to
it
own
silo
veget
over
here
and
anim
there
and
grain
somewher
els
all
the
compon
part
are
kept
apart
and
becaus
they
’
re
unhitch
from
each
other
unsurprisingli
they
re
unhitch
from
ani
kind
of
food
cultur
so
what
is
the
role
of
the
chef
it
’
s
to
help
with
the
hitch
to
show
there
is
pleasur
good
tast
and
environment
sustain
in
foster
connect
after
all
that
’
s
what
cuisin
is
the
way
a
region
’
s
uniqu
ecolog
relationship
and
place
specif
advantag
and
challeng
becom
manifest
through
delici
food
you
see
thi
time
again
throughout
histori
when
parmesan
chees
wa
develop
in
parma
itali
it
creat
an
excess
of
whey
so
the
farmer
fed
the
whey
to
their
pig
—
and
then
they
cure
the
meat
and
got
prosciutto
di
parma
the
whey
a
byproduct
of
the
parmesan
process
fatten
the
pig
into
thi
wonder
flavor
and
delici
ham
or
when
french
peasant
wonder
what
do
to
with
the
tough
and
ined

of

they
broke
down
the

of

and
got

you
find
that
in
southern
cuisin
too
hoppin
’
john
—
a
quintessenti
southern
dish
—
is
rice
but
it
’
s
also
cowpea
that
legumin
crop
wa
so
import
in
the
south
becaus
it
allow
the
southern
to
preserv
their
soil
well
enough
to
get
them
rice
then
they
mix
in
collard
green
becaus
collard
help
desalin
the

and
some
bacon
becaus
pig
were
also
part
of

agricultur
in

peopl
creat

to

and
they
becom

in

of

most
of

lack

cuisin
becaus
we

never

the

onc
we
had
the
greatest

in

we
’

it
for
200
plu
year
the
colonist
who
came
over
from
europ
were
not
veri
great
farmer
when
their
soil
fail
most
farmer
drop
their
farm
and
move
west
—
where
they
repeat
the
same
pattern
in
europ
you
couldn
’
t
just
pick
up
and
go
somewher
new
and
cuisin
were
develop
as

eke
out

they
could
with

land
and
resourc
no

but

knew
intuit
you
couldn

the

in

and
that
you
need
to
mix
your
crop
and
that
certain
crop
work
beauti
—
symbiot
—
in

they
need
soil
fertil
so
they
creat
a
system
of
agricultur
to
support
it
—
and
then
a
cuisin
to
support
that
system
american
were
never

so
i

it

instead
they
were

outsid

the

program
that
they

is

through
connect

is
hope
she
can

jump
start

if

of

and
photograph
that
she
captur
when
speak
with
veteran
farmer
of

the
project
as
she
see
it
is
a
way
not
onli
to
preserv
the
tradit
of
black
farmer
but
also
to
build
solidar
it
s
true
that
for
youth
of

head
back
to
the
farm
recal
a
fraught
histori
of
slaveri
and
exploit
migrant

she
say
that
immigr

often
say
whi
would
i
go

that
my

up
the
pitchfork

my

is
that
we
can

that
bowen
say
who

go

in
the

right
now
black

are
a
die
breed
fewer
than
1
percent
of
america
s
farm
are
own
by
black
down
from
14
percent
in
1920
those
who
remain
may
not
be
around
for
much
longer
the
averag
age
of
the
farmer
is
about
60
year
old
bowen
say
and
it
s
even
higher
for
black
farmer
bowen
then
is
part
of
a
tenuou
link
between
age
black
farmer
and
she
hope
a
new
wave
of
agrarian
if
fellow
young
food
activist
of

can
t
look
past
the
stigma
of
farm
labor
and
the
food
justic
movement
doesn
t
priorit
commun
of

then
the
goal
of

sovereignti
will
remain
out

some

tri
to
