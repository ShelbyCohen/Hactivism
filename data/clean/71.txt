but
as

“

is
far
from

with

there
is
no

perhap
some

there
would
be
noth

for

a

motiv
by
either
faith

if
he
or
she
strictli
follow
direct
the
action
will
not
suffer
and
it
may
be
strengthen
one
side
of

process
is
to

that
face

the
inadequaci
of

even
mistak
in

and
to

the
other
side
is
open
up
the
way
that
lead

peopl
who
keep

it

what

the

choic
–
is
the
most
wide
research

in

from
explor
of

of

to
the
stori
of

who

it

’

it

the

of

we
have
learn
how

not
how

so
that

we
know
how
to
launch
new
social

like
occupi
and
those
of
the

but
not
how
to
sustain
their

inde
some

that

whose

as

to
the

instinct
when
under

these

may

by

we

”
take
occupi
for
exampl
when
i
interview
activist
from
occupi
oakland
in
2013
mani
said
that
thing
got
tough
not
when
face
a
common
enemi
but
when
face
a
common
alli
as
in
each
other
the
other
reason
is
that
the
modu
operandi
of
most
contemporari
system
is
to
keep
peopl
from
work
togeth
especi
around
the
thing
that
realli
matter

constantli
push
peopl
toward

away
from

so
while
cooper
may
be
woven
into
our
dna
it
still
ha
to
be
cultiv
conscious
and
use
but
how
it
’
s
here
that
some
deeper
lesson
can
be
learn
from
jevtić
’
s
heroic
about
differ
form
of

kenneth
bould
a
well
known
economist
and
peac
research
divid
power
into
three
differ
categori
the
power
of
threat
or
coercion
‘
give
me
what
i
want
or
els
’
the
power
of
exchang
‘
give
me
what
i
want
and
i
’
ll
give
you
someth
els
that
you
want
too
’
and
“
integr
power
”
of
the
kind
that
jevtić
deploy
when
he
risk
hi
life
for
other
integr
power
say
simpli
and
courag
“
i
’
ll
do
what
i
think
is
right
”
and
it
will
bring
us
closer
by
reinforc
what
we
hold
in
common
at
the
deepest
level
it
’
s
the
same
principl
as
ubuntu
in
southern
africa
“
i
am
becaus
you
are
”
“
i
affirm
my
human
through

human
be
”
jevtić
refus
to
cooper
with
the
serbian
armi
’
s
attempt
to
dehuman
other
peopl
to
that
extent
he
reaffirm
hi
own
human
but
he
also
show
how
a
deep
connect
to
the
same
human
in
other
can
make
it
possibl
to
co
oper
across
the
line
of
differ
whether
in
extremi
or
in
the
regular
activ
of
social
movement
like
occupi
when
they
begin
to
fractur
integr
power
show
how
act
of
nonviol
can
encourag
the
same
respons
in
other
by
help
them
to
connect
with
their
own
reservoir
of
moral
courag
so
that
they
can
sustain
their
effort
over
time
it
’
s
thi
creativ
forc
that
can
be
translat
into
concret
polit
action
that
go
beyond
civil
disobedi
to
underpin
the
practic
of
“
pre
figur
polit
”
creat
new
econom
and
polit
system
around
a
differ
imag
of
what
is
possibl
and
who
we
realli
are
“

said
mahatma

“
