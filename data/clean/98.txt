the
problem
you
may
ask
the
main
problem
is
that
it

s
a
utopian
vision
i

the

goe
in
depth
on
how
the

will
look

it
offer
no
vision
on
how
to
creat
the

within

the

problem
is
essenti
an
extens
of
the

peopl
should
not

what
kind
of

the
danger
of
becom

but
“

”
ha
no
mention
of
how
to
get
from
here
to
there
troublesom
in
the
dialogu
i
have
heard
as

for

the
lack
of

within
the

and
accept

2009
thi
is
a
strang
statement
for
joseph
after
all
he
is

and
obsolet
want
to
abolish
the

the

it
sound

like
histor
polit

that
aros

the
develop

and

’
s
respons
to
it
these
are
those
peski
work

peopl
that
joseph
is
reluct
to
mention
i
e
marxism
and
anarch
perhap
he
’
s
been
on
the
fring
right
wing
for
so
long
studi
conspirac
which
seem
to
be
not
so
en
vogu
these
day
as
evidenc
by
the
popular
of
thi
zeitgeist
thing
that
he
doesn

t
know
hi
histori
for
a
movement
to
be
“
polit
”
it
doesn

t
requir
polit
parti
and
leadership
polit
movement
can
be
non
hierarch
and
have
noth
to
do
with
the
state
or
like
anarch
be
against
the
state
one
would
think
that
someon
who
is
articul
a
framework
for
overthrow
the
state
and
capit
would
have
done
some
research
either
joseph
is
omit
the
work
of
marx
and
classic
anarch
i
e
the
revolutionari
aspect
of
what
is
call
the
left
or
he
is
simpli
omit
the
histori
to
appeal
to
a
constitu
that
is
of
the
extremist
right
think
about
the
opposit
scenario
let
’
s
assum
that
i
tri
to
sell
a
scheme
to
the
left
that
involv
complet
deregul
market
date
idea
like
the
gold
standard
condemn
war
becaus
it
isn
’
t
cost
effect
seek
to
abolish
all
tax
and
reduc
the
role
of
govern
but
never
mention
the
histori
of
lasaiz
fair
econom
i
don
’
t
think
that
the
left
would
be
as
kind
and
quickli
point
out
that
i
am
tri
to
pitch
them
a
rehash
water
down
version
of
capit
a
histor
account
are
troublesom
in
ani
regard
the
american
“
progress
”
commun
is
quick
to
point
out
the
crimin
action
of
republican
presid
like
georg
w
bush
but
slow
or
retic
to
discuss
analog
and
equal
atroci
act
commit
by
presid
like
jfk
or
bill
clinton
the
conspiracist
right
wing
is
also
retic
in
regard
to
the
former
for
thi
the
so
call
“
progress
”
or
the
“
left
of
center
”
get
nowher
and
are
not
to
be
taken
serious
the
zeitgeist
movement
is
compar
in
thi
regard
either
joseph
doesn
’
t
understand
what
a
polit
movement
is
or
wors
thi
isn
’
t
a
polit
movement
the
latter
would
suggest
that
the
“
activist
arm
”
of
the
venu
project
is
realli
just
part
of
the
larger
lucr
conspiraci
industri
that
attract
an
extrem
alien
work
class
to
invest
money
in
their
pyramid
scheme
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
polit
movement
would
suggest
that
thi
is
simpli
just
a
neat
idea
that
is
fun
to
read
about
in
thi
case
there
is
a
vast
bodi
of
futurist
fiction
in
which
case
whatev
one
think
about
it
it
is
at
least
candid
about
the
fact
that
it
is
scienc
fiction
if
the
former
is
true
then
the
zeitgeist
movement
repres
vulgar
utopian
joseph
and
the
venu
project
are
propos
someth
radic
they
are

that
human
essenti
abolish
the

state
parliamentari
bodi
and
capit
there
are
mani
assumpt
that
can
be
made
about
the

as
such
but
i
will
limit
it
to
these
for

joseph
and
propon
of
the
venu
project
believ
that
they
can
achiev
thi
new
societi
through
reform
becaus
to
my
knowledg
they
do
not
speak
or
write
about
a
clash
with
the
state
i
e
revolut
2
they
are
come
from
an
angl
that
suggest
that
thi
will
happen
when
there
is
a
conscious
shift
i
e
human
are
too
stupid
and
greedi
to
have
thi
societi
at
the
moment
3
they
have
a
naïv
assumpt
and
again
an
a
histor
stanc
on
what
happen
to
the
work
class
doe
joseph
even
mention
them
when
they
attempt
to
overthrow
the
bourgeoi
state
i
e
fascist
privat
militia
concentr
camp
murder
of
civilian
en
mass
etc
becaus
they
do
not
speak
of
revolut
as
such
or
4
the
propon
of
thi
top
down
movement
do
not
realli
view
it
as
someth
attain
resort
it
to
fiction
or
an
interest
idea
if
the
first
assumpt
is
true
i
e
that
a
technocrat
societi
san
govern
and
capit
could
be
achiev
through
reform
then
thi
movement
is
certainli
not
to
be
taken
serious
is
anyon
realli
naïv
enough
to
believ
that
abolish
the
bourgeoi
nation
state
and
the
arbitrari
econom
system
that
it
resuscit
time
and
time
again
will
be
welcom
by
the
rule
class
thi
is
of
cours
nonsens
but
to
my
knowledg
again
the
zeitgeist
movement
ha
no
class
analysi
no
polit
etc
it
is
agnost
on
everyth
to
perceiv
that
thi

citi
is

somehow
without

shut
it
down

they

that

no

and
is
complet
off

what
is
the

reaction
that

without

we
can
give
a

the

there

those

all
were
socialist
certainli

they
favor
the
mean

polit
power
be
collect
own
by
everyon
but
the
split
came
between
the
authoritarian
and
the
libertarian
socialist
the
statist
wing
and
non
statist

respect
those
libertarian
socialist
came
to
repres
a
revolutionari

that
set
out
to

thi

it

at

both

degrad
subordin
the

joseph

and
a

of

believ

can

there
are
certainli
other

of

idea
whatev
one
may
think
of

i
do
believ
howev
that
the
rigid
of
a

can
alien
anti

and
perhap
joseph
should
sympath
with
all
peopl
who
are
oppos

state
thi
should
be
the
area
on
which
we
focu
instead
of
focus
on
our
ideal
new
societi
i
am
not
suggest
we
should
not
tri
to
build
altern
institut
like
co
op
and
free
space
for
everyon
thi
is
the
kind
of
work
we
should
certainli
take
part
in
but
we
need
not
focu
all
of
our
time
on
someon
’
s
specif
praxi
and
ideal
about
a
futur
societi
it
is
crucial
to
understand
for
these
ideal
futur
societi
to
exist
we
must
dismantl
the
oppress
authoritarian
institut
that
prohibit
joseph
’
s
scientif
green
citi
or
my
ideal
communist
societi
thi
is
where
our
activ
and
certainli
our
creativ
should
focu
further
it
could
be
argu
that
it
is
wast
effort
write
about
someth
so
insignific
like
zeitgeist
it
is
after
all
weak
in
theori
and
seem
to
come
from
a
film
maker
who
realiz
that
the
conspirac
that
made
hi
first
video
so
popular
is
lose
momentum
thi
is
certainli
a
good
thing
that
the
alien
mostli
white
male
who
patron
the
intellectu
bankrupt
industri
of
distract
seem
to
be
abandon
it
but
it
is
sort
of
quasi
anarchist
and
quit
popular
thi
give
libertarian
whether
marxian
or
anarchist
an
opportun
to
discuss
their
idea
with
peopl
who
may
have
previous
been
unsympathet
to
anarch
it
can
be
a
nice
segu
like
“
you
know
thi
whole
zeitgeist
thing
is
pretti
close
to
anarch
”
i
am
not
suggest
that
libertarian
should
be
missionari
alway
tri
to
recruit
new
worship
but
it
is
an
opportun
to
creat
dialogu
which
is
of
the
upmost
import
anti

polit
should
not
be
tuck
away
in
a

with

of

thi

about

what
’
s
the
problem
you
may
ask
the
main
problem
is
that
it
’
s
a
utopian
vision
i
e
the

goe
in
depth
on
how
the
new
world
will
look
but
it
offer
no
vision
on
how
to
creat
the
new
world
within
the
shell
of
the
old
the
second
problem
is
essenti
an
extens
of
the
former
peopl
should
not
be
told
what
kind
of

they
should
have
it
is
highli
doubt
that

can
come
from
an

academ

otherwis
anti

theori
is
participatori
and
if
meaning
is
creat

wherein

to
remain
anti

danger
of
becom

but
“

ha
no
mention
of
how
to
get
from
here
to

troublesom
in

2009
thi
is
a
strang
statement
for
joseph
after
all
he
is
deem
power
structur
useless
and
obsolet
want
to
abolish
the
monetari
system
dismantl
multin
corpor
and
appar
the
nation
state
not
polit
it
sound
an
aw
lot
like
histor
polit
movement
that
aros
through
the
develop
of
capit
and
the
labor
movement
’
s
respons
to
it
these
are
those
peski
work
class
peopl
that
joseph
is
reluct
to
mention
i
e
marxism
and
anarch
perhap
he
’
s
been
on
the
fring
right
wing
for
so
long
studi
conspirac
which
seem
to
be
not
so
en
vogu
these
day
as
evidenc
by
the
popular
of
thi
zeitgeist
thing
that
he
doesn
’
t
know
hi
histori
for
a
movement
to
be
“
polit
”
it
doesn
’
t
requir
polit
parti
and
leadership
polit
movement
can
be
non
hierarch
and
have
noth
to
do
with
the
state
or
like
anarch
be
against
the
state
one
would
think
that
someon
who
is
articul
a
framework
for
overthrow
the
state
and
capit
would
have
done
some
research
either
joseph
is
omit
the
work
of
marx
and
classic
anarch
i
e
the
revolutionari
aspect
of
what
is
call
the
left
or
he
is
simpli
omit
the
histori
to
appeal
to
a
constitu
that
is
of
the
extremist
right
think
about
the
opposit
scenario
let
’
s
assum
that
i
tri
to
sell
a
scheme
to
the
left
that
involv
complet
deregul
market
date
idea
like
the
gold
standard
condemn
war
becaus
it
isn
’
t
cost
effect
seek
to
abolish
all
tax
and
reduc
the
role
of
govern
but
never
mention
the
histori
of
lasaiz
fair
econom
i
don
’
t
think
that
the
left
would
be
as
kind
and
quickli
point
out
that
i
am
tri
to
pitch
them
a
rehash
water
down
version
of
capit
a
histor
account
are
troublesom
in
ani
regard
the
american
“
progress
”
commun
is
quick
to
point
out
the
crimin
action
of
republican
presid
like
georg
w
bush
but
slow
or
retic
to
discuss
analog
and
equal
atroci
act
commit
by
presid
like
jfk
or
bill
clinton
the
conspiracist
right
wing
is
also
retic
in
regard
to
the
former
for
thi
the
so
call
“
progress
”
or
the
“
left
of
center
”
get
nowher
and
are
not
to
be
taken
serious
the
zeitgeist
movement
is
compar
in
thi
regard
either
joseph
doesn
’
t
understand
what
a
polit
movement
is
or
wors
thi
isn
’
t
a
polit
movement
the
latter
would
suggest
that
the
“
activist
arm
”
of
the
venu
project
is
realli
just
part
of
the
larger
lucr
conspiraci
industri
that
attract
an
extrem
alien
work
class
to
invest
money
in
their
pyramid
scheme
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
polit
movement
would
suggest
that
thi
is
simpli
just
a
neat
idea
that
is
fun
to
read
about
in
thi
case
there
is
a
vast
bodi
of
futurist
fiction
in
which
case
whatev
one
think
about
it
it
is
at
least
candid
about
the
fact
that
it
is
scienc
fiction
if
the
former
is
true
then
the
zeitgeist
movement
repres
vulgar
utopian
joseph
and
the
venu
project
are
propos
someth
radic
they
are
propos
that
human
essenti
abolish
the
nation
state
parliamentari
bodi
and
capit
there
are
mani
assumpt
that
can
be
made
about
the
zeitgeist
movement
as
such
but
i
will
limit
it
to
these
for
the
moment
1
joseph
and
propon
of
the
venu
project
believ
that
they
can
achiev
thi
new
societi
through
reform
becaus
to
my
knowledg
they
do
not
speak
or
write
about
a
clash
with
the
state
i
e
revolut
2
they
are
come
from
an
angl
that
suggest
that
thi
will
happen
when
there
is
a
conscious
shift
i
e
human
are
too
stupid
and
greedi
to
have
thi
societi
at
the
moment
3
they
have
a
naïv
assumpt
and
again
an
a
histor
stanc
on
what
happen
to
the
work
class
doe
joseph
even
mention
them
when
they
attempt
to
overthrow
the
bourgeoi
state
i
e
fascist
privat
militia
concentr
camp
murder
of
civilian
en
mass
etc
becaus
they
do
not
speak
of
revolut
as
such
or
4
the
propon
of
thi
top
down
movement
do
not
realli
view
it
as
someth
attain
resort
it
to
fiction
or
an
interest
idea
if
the
first
assumpt
is
true
i
e
that
a
technocrat
societi
san
govern
and
capit
could
be
achiev
through
reform
then
thi
movement
is
certainli
not
to
be
taken
serious
is
anyon
realli
naïv
enough
to
believ
that
abolish
the
bourgeoi
nation
state
and
the
arbitrari
econom
system
that
it
resuscit
time
and
time
again
will
be
welcom
by
the
rule
class
thi
is
of
cours
nonsens
but
to
my
knowledg
again
the
zeitgeist
movement
ha
no
class
analysi
no
polit
etc
it
is
agnost
on
everyth
to
perceiv
that
thi
first
sustain
citi
is
built
somehow
without
the
capitalist
shut
it
down
ani
way
they
can
let
us
hypothet
extrapol
on
the
scenario
a
citi
get
built
in
we
’
re
assum
the
western
world
becaus
third

us
client
state
would
simpli
cut
their
head
off
the
second
they
said
they
were
go
to
build
an
autonom
self
sustain
citi
that
is
autonom
ha
no
allegi
to
ani
govern
ani
monetari
system
and
is
complet
off
the
grid
what
is
the
first
reaction
that
the
state
will
have
well
i
would
extrapol
that
the
nation
guard
blackwat
and
other
fascist
privat

the

probabl
everi

forc
in

everyon
they

thi
is
if
they
do
not

drop

thi

of

without
digress
into
too
much
detail
we
can
give
a
brief
overview
as
such
show
the
split
in
the
1870

in

thi
wa
an
anti

intern
organ
of
the
work
class
that
wa
communist
and
socialist
but
there
wa
a
major
differ
within
the
organ
those
that
side
with
marx
and
engel
and
those
that
side
with
anarchist
mikhail
bakunin
soon
to
becom
one
of
marx
’
s
loath
rival
all
were
socialist
certainli
mean
simpli
they
favor
the
mean
of
product
and
polit
power
be
collect
own
by
everyon
but
the
split
came
between
the
authoritarian
and
the
libertarian
socialist
the
statist
wing
and
non
statist
wing
respect
those
libertarian
socialist
came
to
repres
a
revolutionari
philosophi
that
set
out
to
dismantl
capit
the
state
and
all
other
oppress
hierarch
structur
thi
wa
the
philosophi
of
anarch
so
anarch
is
certainli
a
polit
movement
ye
it
seek
no
polit
parti
or
major
organ
to
govern
the
peopl
and
abhor
the
notion
of
parliamentari

govern
but
it
seek
to
put
polit

of
commun
through
whatev

the
commun
deem
appropri
i
e
direct
democraci
consensu
worker
council
or
even
technocraci
like
joseph
condon
perhap
thi
is
what
joseph
mean
to
say
the
zeitgeist
movement
doe
not
seek
to
establish
some
kind
of
polit
parti
or
organ
but
it
is
certainli
a
polit

sinc
it
seek
to
put
the
polit

in

an
anarchocentr
critiqu
of
the
zeitgeist
movement
doesn
’
t
reject
mani
of
the
idea
for
which
joseph
ha
present
but
there
are
major
fallaci
joseph
ha
propos
a
futurist
societi
that
will
not
appeal
to
everyon
as
the
end
all
solut
to
our
problem
i
certainli
wouldn

like
the
one
joseph
speak
of

as
far
as
i
’
m
concern
if
the
major
of
the
work

is
not

then
the

is
not

if
the
second
principl
is
the

i

they
believ
that
such

can

come
about
when
there
is
a

thi
would
be
a

which
condon
some

compar
pacifist
might
tell
the
palestinian

pacif

some

while

acknowledg
that

joseph
is
correct

will
most

when
one
ha

platform
speak
of
these
ill
as
if
they
happen
in
a
vacuum
i
find
it
quit
troubl
when
the
word
“

slaveri
”
“
subordin
”
and
perhap
most
importantli
“
privat
properti
”
are
miss
from

it
beg

suggest
liber
and

like
the
social
democrat
attempt
to
creat
a
“

capit
zeitgeist
’
s
valu
and
optim
in
thi
essay
i
could
be
perceiv
as
one
who
ha
written
the
zeitgeist
movement
off
as
conspiracist
drivel
mostli
i
have
howev
at
the
crux
of
it
there
are
anarchist
connot
who
’
s
to
say
that
thi
is
not
prefigur
polit
i
e
the
idea
of
build
a
new
world
in
the
shell
of
the
old
or
who
could
argu
that
if
thi
truli
wa
a
decentr
non
hierarch
free
space
for
peopl
it
is
not
strive
to
build
a
dual
power
structur
both
prefigur
polit
and
dual
power
build
are
both
anarchist
tendenc
and
i
argu
the
zeitgeist
movement
could
be
that
also
certainli
environment
degrad
subordin
the
major
of
human
be
who
would
not
destroy
the
planet
left
to
their
own
vice
to
the
miniscul
percent
of
the
popul
of
properti
owner
who
are
destroy
the
planet
joseph
is
address
these
problem
and
a
major
of
hi
audienc
is
come
from
the
conspiraci
industri
that
predominantli
believ
global
warm
is
a
hoax
creat
to
perpetu
social
through
carbon
tax
no
i
’
m
not
kid
the
fact
that
a
constitu
who
bought
ultra
extrem
ideolog
for
so
long
seem
to
be
accept
of
the
sustain
technocraci
for
which
joseph
is
a
propon
is
certainli
less
wors
but
is
the
technocrat
metropoli
someth
that
can
ever
be
sustain
ha
“
zeitgeist
”
thought
outsid
the
box
or
would
fresco
’
s
sustain
citi
be
everi
bit
as
alien
as
our
current
“
citi
”
further
can
we
reach
sustain
without
creat
new
paradigm
i
believ
it
is
doubt
i
think
prax
that
explain
“
thi
is
the
way
to
freedom
”
can
be
interest
there
are
certainli
other
exampl
of
classic
anarchist
like
jame
guillam
and
peter
kropotkin
write
specif
about
their
ideal
commun
or
even
michael
albert
with
hi
intric
plan
“
parecon
”
idea
whatev
one
may
think
of
it
i
do
believ
howev
that
the
rigid
of
a
plan
can
alien
anti
authoritarian
and
perhap
joseph
should
sympath
with
all
peopl
who
are
oppos
to
capit
and
state
thi
should
be
the
area
on
which
we
focu
instead
of
focus
on
our
ideal
new
societi
i
am
not
suggest
we
should
not
tri
to
build
altern
institut
like
co
op
and
free
space
for
everyon
thi
is
the
kind
of
work
we
should
certainli
take
part
in
but
we
need
not
focu
all
of
our
time
on
someon
’
s
specif
praxi
and
ideal
about
a
futur
societi
it
is
crucial
to
understand
for
these
ideal
futur
societi
to
exist
we
must
dismantl
the
oppress
authoritarian
institut
that
prohibit
joseph
’
s
scientif
green
citi
or
my
ideal
communist
societi
thi
is
where
our
activ
and
certainli
our
creativ
should
focu
further
it
could
be
argu
that
it
is
wast
effort
write
about
someth
so
insignific
like
zeitgeist
it
is
after
all
weak
in
theori
and
seem
to
come
from
a
film
maker
who
realiz
that
the
conspirac
that
made
hi
first
video
so
popular
is
lose
momentum
thi
is
certainli
a
good
thing
that
the
alien
mostli
white
male
who
patron
the
intellectu
bankrupt
industri
of
distract
seem
to
be
abandon
it
but
it
is
sort
of
quasi
anarchist
and
quit
popular
thi
give
libertarian
whether
marxian
or
anarchist
an
opportun
to
discuss
their
idea
with
peopl
who
may
have
previous
been
unsympathet
to
anarch
it
can
be
a
nice
segu
like
“
you
know
thi
whole
zeitgeist
thing
is
pretti
close
to
anarch
”
i
am
not
suggest
that
libertarian
should
be
missionari
alway
tri
to
recruit
new
worship
but
it
is
an
opportun
to
creat
dialogu
which
is
of
the
upmost
import
anti
authoritarian
polit
should
not
be
tuck
away
in
a
dusti
closet
with
the
popular
of
the
zeitgeist
movement
thi
dialogu
could
happen
on
a
larg
scale
and
that
is
