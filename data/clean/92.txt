the
broader
failur
i
suggest
is
not
that
of

of
the

parti
that
she
not
onli
shape
but
that
shape
her
the
legaci
of
fdr
wa
a
parti
that
with
mani
fail
wa
seen
as
the
champion
of
the
work
class
and
the
poor
and
larg
part
of
thi
legaci
remain
at
least
through
the
great
societi
of
lyndon
johnson
the
leadership
of
the
democrat
parti
began
to
pull
away
from
that
legaci
under
carter
and
bill
clinton
the
neoliber
new
democrat
with
the
ascend
of
leader
who
could
not
and
did
not
want
to
speak
for
them
the
work
class
began
to
leav
the
parti
of
roosevelt
state
that
had
onc
been
democrat
stronghold
such
as
wisconsin
michigan
and
pennsylvania
becam
battleground
state
while
it
is
true
that
trump
’
s
win
margin
wa
small
in
those
state
the
real
question
is
whi
million
of
work
class
peopl
had
previous
move
over
to
the
republican
parti
in
number
suffici
to
make
those
state
even
close
the
berni
sander
campaign
prove
at
least
one
thing
there
are
still
million
of
american
who
respond
to
the
spirit
of
the
social
democrat
messag
that
fdr
articul
in
hi
1944
state
of
the
union
address
had
clinton
understood
that
she
might
have
brought
home
to
the
democrat
parti
the
key
work
class
voter
who
cost
her
the
elect
unfortun
she
her
husband
barack
obama
and
their
neolib
alli
had
hollow
out
the
ideolog
core
of
the
parti
and
she
could
not
make
up
for
that
loss
by
order
her
staff
to
find
a
rational
for
her
candidaci
it
wa
too
much
to
expect
that
a
candid
who
hung
out
with
millionair
pal
in
the
hampton
and
who
took
hundr
of
thousand
from
goldman
sach
could
truli
understand
the
fear
and
hope
of

american
but
from
clinton
’

a
catastroph
in

mani
way
may
come
