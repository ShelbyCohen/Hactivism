improv
upon

while

here
i
will
rais
a
few
question
as
to
what
the
supersess
of
the
si
’
s
theori
might
look
like
in
1919
lukac
wrote
of
the
situat
in
the
soviet
union
“
t
he
class
struggl
is
now
be
fought
from
abov
”
thi
is
a
ridicul
ideolog
assert
but
what
is
it
in
lukac
’
theori
or
in
marx
’
s
that
might
lead
one
to
say
someth
like
thi
in
1969
the
si
bemoan
a
“
lack
of
theoret
knowledg
of
the
autonom
goal
of
the
proletarian
class
struggl
”
i
’
m
not
sure
exactli
what
wa
meant
by
thi
but
doe
the
“
proletarian
class
struggl
”
have
goal
how
were
russian
anarchist
abl
to
call
the
bolshevik
regim
state
capitalist
as
earli
as
1918
a
year
befor
lukac
gave
hi
marxist
opinion
on
the
issu
anarchist
opposit
to
the
state
can
seem
rather
crude
from
a
marxist
standpoint
even
pure
ideolog
but
if
the
marxist
see
the
class
struggl
as
have
goal
that
flow
through
histori
and
hover
somewher
abov
realiti
is
thi
not
ideolog
determin
did
inde
appear
in

the
si
often
wrote
about
the
rapid
develop
of
technolog
as
someth
that
help
enabl
the
birth
of
communist
societi
the
basi
for
thi
way
of
see
thing
is
the
marxist
notion
of
a
grow
contradict
between
the
forc
of
product
and
the
properti
relat
of

societi
the
si
like

had
a
rather
optimist
attitud
toward
technolog
now
it
seem
thi
attitud
could
onli
be
naivet
other
aspect
of
the
si
that

today
includ
