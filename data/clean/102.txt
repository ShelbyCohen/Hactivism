the

these
assumpt
may
hold

at
thi
point
in

but
as
wa
seen
in

in

2007
they
are
far
from
immut
a
social
movement
that
make
a
fetish
of
the
rule
of

is
make
a
grave
mistak
on
the
other
hand
a
social

that
disavow
human

becaus
they
implic
law
is
make
just
as
great
a
mistak
the
idea
of

therefor
requir
further
analysi

elabor
in

to

–
to
challeng
