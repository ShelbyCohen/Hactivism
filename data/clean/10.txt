is
troubl
he

sinc
the
begin

leader
have
been
oust
in
egypt
tunisia
libya
and
yemen
at
the
start
it
would
have
been
hard
to
imagin
how
much
the
movement
would
spread
throughout
the
region
hamid
say
but
it
certainli
can
t
be
said
that
it
came
out
of
nowher
the
revolut
had
been
build
up
for
decad
in
egypt
he
say
i
think
there
wa
a
loss
of
faith
in
work
within
the
system
and
that
s
when
peopl
began
to
think
more
and
more
about
civil
disobedi
mass
protest
and
go
out
in
to
the
street
he
say
when
your
polit
process
fail
you
there
s
realli
onli
one
option
left
a
continu
battl
if
storm
the
street
is
the
onli
plan
the
activist
had
then
they
were
at
a
disadvantag
from
day

senior

dergham
believ
the

activist
where
hijack

islamist
group
when
the
youth
went
to
tahrir
squar
and
other
place
they
want
a

futur
dergham
say
suddenli
they
were
encroach
upon
by
the
veri
well
organ
and
well
experienc
islamist
parti
and
they
won
the
day
dergham
say
peopl
should
not
prematur
celebr
what
is
be
call
moder
islam
as
long
as
there
is
no
separ
between
religion
and
the
state
she
say
there
will
be
a
huge
price
to
be
paid
by
much
of
the
popul
in
the
arab
region
—
particularli
women
the
bottom
line
she
say
is
that
the
men
in
power
will
have
the
author
to
interpret
the
law
set
in
sharia
or
islam
law
they
have
the
right
in
that
case
to
say
what
the

are

guarante
that
there
will
be
a
civil
constitut
that
would
rule
ani
countri
where
islamist
win
the
day
in
elect
no
problem
but
i
m
afraid
that
we
do
not
have
ani
such
guarante
in
a
recent
column
dergham
wrote
that
the
arab
awaken
will
end
in
the
slumber
of
dark
age
if
arab
women
fail
to
take
the
initi
she
say
they
should
stand
up
to
the
islamist
now
for
the
right
of
women
in
the
new
arab
world
these
women
fought
with
these
young
men
to
bring
the
chang
she
say
they
should
not
be
sidelin
watch
the
arab
spring
dure
the
past
year
dergham
say
she
often
feel
like
she
s
on
a
seesaw
one
moment
she
is
exhilar
and
proud
of
what
ha
taken
place
and

question
what

it
wa
a
