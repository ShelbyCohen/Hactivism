not
the
titl
dear
reader
activ
is
not
an
elit
word
i
promis
stick
with
me
i
don
t
know
if
you
have
ever
been
put
off
by
or
intimid
by
that
word
think
yeah
sure
i
care
about
stuff
but
i
m
not
an
activist
me
too
and
i
m
on
a
mission
to
claim
it
back
for
the
everyday
person
here
s
how
the
dictionari
defin
it
noun
1
an
especi
activ
vigor
advoc
of
a
caus
especi
apolit
caus
oooh
those
word
especi
activ
and
vigor
don
t
sit
well
with
me
not
in
light
of
what
i
want
to
cover
in
thi
post
today
they
glorifi
onli
the
do
side
of
activ
but
today
i
want
to
open
that
word
up
spin
it
about
and
hope
give
you
some
food
for
thought
as
i
said
befor
in
the
intro
to
thi
seri
on
slow
thing
down
i
m
a
natur
do
er
someon
who
when
present
with
an
issu
like
to
have
a
clear
vision
of
what
the
action
to
take
is
and
then
set
a
path
to
take
it
thi
slow
busi
isn
t
my
natur
rhythm
but
it
s
one
that
i
ve
come
to
valu
and
see
the
import
in
so
i
hope
that
in
dialog
with
you
through
here
and
on
facebook
and
twitter
we
can
all
myself
includ
cultiv
and
give
ourselv
permiss
to
slow
down
and
be
more
mind
i
wa
rais
as
an
activist
my
parent
might
not
have
seen
to
label
their
parent
in
that
way
but
i
wa
definit
born
into
a
famili
tune
into
advocaci
it
wa
hard
not
to
be
when
your
parent
were
activ
involv
in
social
work
from
befor
you
were
born
welcom
all
kind
of
interest
and
desper
peopl
into
our
home
involv
in
a
church
that
wa
practic
and
outward
focus
it
wa
a
vibrant
childhood
and
they
model
compass
and
inclus
so
much
so
that
it
feel
like
part
of
my
dna
i
guess
it
s
hard
to
tell
when
the
activist
in
me
realli
came
to
life
becaus
advoc
ha
alway
felt
natur
i
say
that
more
as
an
observ
of
how
i
grew
up
than
ani
kind
of
piou
claim
och
would
you
look
at
us
here
the
80
s
were
kind
to
no
one
have
been
involv
in
activ
for
mani
year
both
passiv
by
observ
the
way
my
parent
did
life
and
then
activ
in
my
teen
and
adult
year
i
m
realli
keen
to
explor
it
s
mani
facet
and
am
particularli
drawn
these
day
to
look
at
activ
through
the
len
of
slow
to
reflect
on
how
mayb
if
we
can
har
our
energi
for
care
about
stuff
and
give
it
some
mind
purpos
leg
we
can
actual
see
the
world
chang
in
a
more
long
last
way
i
thought
i
d
start
by
share
what
i
ve
identifi
as
3
key
habit
of
slow
activist
that
lead
to
long
last
social
chang
1
a
slow
activist
isn
t
deter
when
the
hype
or
lure
of
a
mainstream
issu
or
campaign
die
down
becaus
they
are
in
it
for
the
long
haul
let
me
take
you
back
a
few
year
to
2012
thi
wa
the
year
that
koni
2012
hit
our
screen
the
world
woke
up
one
morn
to
a
video
by
the
chariti
invis
children
go
viral
about
joseph
koni
leader
of
the
lord
resist
armi
in
uganda
and

wage
in
vulner
region
forc
children
to
take
up
arm
and
becom
soldier

of

the
craftiv
collect
movement
is
a
great
exampl
of
thi
craftivist
collect
wa
found
in
2009
when
after
year
of
march
sign
protest
and
work
on
campaign
for
larg
chariti
experienc
activist
sarah
corbett
had
begun
to
doubt
the
effect
of
some
convent
activ
the
time
felt
right
for
a
differ
less
aggress
approach
a
love
of
cross
stitch
led
her
to
craftiv
it
appeal
as
a
gentl
respect
and
more
target
plea
for
social
chang
wa
a
perfect
fit
and
although
as
a
principl
‘
craftiv
’
alreadi
exist
it
took
no
time
for
sarah
to
develop
her
own
uniqu
strand
one
focus
on
put
the
contempl
moment
spent
stitch
to
work
explor
global

and
use

for

and
consid

all
of
these
small
everi

thing
connect
us
to

that
kind
of
slow

a
slow
activist
celebr
small
victori
even
when
the
weight
of
the
burden
still
tip
heavili
the
other
way
it
is
like
that
if
you
consid
yourself
an
activist
that
you
think
deepli
about
thing
and
sometim
in
the
midst
of
the
heavi
of

so

complex
we
fail
to
recognis
the
import
of
small

it
is
so
much
more
emot
healthi
for
us
to
work
thi
way
to
feel
mobilis
instead
of
paralys
by
the
magnitud
of
need
it
is
estim
that
over
30
million
peopl
are
current
be
exploit
in
some
form
of
modern
slaveri
that
s
a
statist
that
s
hard
to
swallow
and
ha
the
potenti
to
daunt
peopl
into
reactionari
action
throw
money
at
the
problem
instead
of
respons
action
find
a
more
sustain
way
to
have
an
impact
from
april
of
2015
to
now
jan
2016
there
have
been
46
preciou
human
be
recov
from
be
exploit
in
some
form
of
modern
slaveri
here
in
northern
ireland
that
is
0

of
a
dent
in
the
issu
is
it
much
no
is
it
worthless
absolut
not
it
is
anoth
increas
on
recov
victim
from
last
year
it
indic
a
better
grasp
than
befor
by
polic
by
commun
it
is
alway
worth
mark
thi
kind
of
small
victori
becaus
it
give
us
the
motiv
and
direct
to
keep
move
if
we
are
onli
ever
wow
by
huge
chang
by
implement
of
law
or
polici
then
we
are
doom
to
lose
steam
those
kind
of
chang
are
hard
won
they
take
time
endur
and
invest
on
mani
level
so
mani
of
the
thing
that
i
long
to
see
differ
in
the
world
i
will
never
see
in
thi
lifetim
and
i
m
ok
in
that
understand
becaus
i
know
i
am
build
on
work
that
other
peopl
have
start
and
if
i
do
my
part
there
will
be
mani
that
will
pick
up
the
reign
long
after
i
m
gone
we
must
not
undervalu
the
small
mileston
that
indic
we
are
on
the
right
track
these
are
our
fuel
on
the
long
road
to
chang
i
feel
like
there
is
so
much
more
to
say
on
thi
and
i
certainli
haven

exhaust
my
thought
i
might
come

over
the

exampl
of
other

is
a

to
focu
on

direct

and
advocaci
tactic
is
the
oper
word
two
of
my
favorit
theorist
come
to
mind
the
chicana
feminist
thinker
chela
sandov
and
the
argentin
born
anthropologist
néstor
garcia
canclini
i
propos
we
consid
their
advic
for
how
to
engag
a
tactic
art
activ
in
the
current
context
in
which
we
find
ourselv
sandov
’
s
concept
of
tactic
activ
is
elabor
in
her
classic
book
methodolog
of
the
oppress
thi
is
the
concept
of
the
“
differenti
”
sandov
’
s
construct
of
“
the
differenti
”
is
not
unlik
the
differenti
in
the
manual
transmiss
of
a
car
–
it
is
the
mechan
that
allow
gear
to
shift
base
on
chang
terrain
it
is
what
make
the
car
adapt
like
the
now
old
fashion
stick

sandov
assert
that
contemporari

can
be
more
effect
by
be
knowledg
about
and
prepar
to
use
multipl
method
in
their
pursuit
of
social
chang
they
must
have
“
differenti
conscious
”
and
engag
in
“

”
that
allow
them
to
shift
“
gear
”
deftli
from
one
approach
to
anoth
in

environ
of

it
is
not
enough
to
use
one
method
or
pursu
a
singl
unvari
strategi
today
’
s
effect
art
activist
must
be
prepar
with
a
toolkit
of
divers
method
and
a
tactic
mindset
my
other
favorit
theorist
to
whom
i
recommend
we
look
for
advic
is
néstor
garcia
canclini
in
hi
1995

argu

thi
a

it
feel

so
whi
when
it
come
to
campaign
for
a
healthier
happier
and
fairer
world
for
all
is
much
of

i

a
few
year
ago
there
are

of

one
big
reason
wa
that
i
wa
do
too
much
too
fast
i
just
didn
’
t
stop
or
slow
down
angri
activ
befor
i
would
get
so
angri
and
then
emot
exhaust
see
injustic
happen
in
our
area
or
in
the
world
should
make
us
feel
angri
and
want
to
stand
up
against
them
anger
is
one
of
the
strongest
emot
we
have
and
it
can
give
us
courag
to
take
action
but
we
know
that
react
in
anger
isn
’
t
alway
that
effect
if
we
don
’
t
make
time
to
channel
that
anger
into
a
wiser
strategi
we
can
say
and
do
thing
we
later
regret
becaus
our
anger
blind
us
i
can
understand
how
peopl
’
s
anger
can
turn
violent
we
can
feed
off
other
protest
’
emot
and
energi
and
then
releas
it
through

disrespect
messag
or
with
a
violenc
against
a

or
properti
despit
good
intent
unless
we
invest
time
in

our
angri
activ
can
lead
to

can

aggress
is
a

for

in

parti
not

space
for

if
we
are
ask

to

with

then
isn

t
it
contradictori
to

wa
eat

and
no

want
to

where
the
peopl
involv
look
exhaust

we
know
from

that

not

them

no

act
fast
against

if
a
govern
is
tri
to

without

know
then
we
need
quickli
to
shine
a
spotlight
on
it
so
that
peopl
are
awar
and
can
question
it
the
quickest
way
to
do
thi
is
sign
a

attent
through

and
through
peopl
speak
out
howev
there
were
so
mani
injustic
in

i

deepli
about
it
wa
hard
to

and
prioritis
other
there
were
so
mani
activist
group
to

so
mani
action
to

so
i
would
go

some
of

write

i
also
struggl
to
ignor
them
they
were
so
demand
and
it
wa
overwhelm
to

i
often
becam
numb
to
the

so
that
i
could
get
as
much
done
as
possibl
without
feel
emot
drain
or
start
think
too
much
in

mayb
thi
wa
my
way
of
cope
it
wa
easier
to
do
lot
of
quick
transact
rather
than
think
through
what
would
be
the
best
use
of
my
time
and
what
were
the
root
caus
of
thi

i
felt
that
i

show
my
solidar

those
affect

i
didn

have
to
slow
down

i
knew
that

are

not
onli
wa
i
burn
out
as

i
becam
realli
worri
that
i

treat

too
i

be
ask

on

as
possibl
to
show
that
the
public
care
about

if
peopl
ask
me
for
more
inform
i
didn

t
see
that
as
a
great
opportun
to
discuss
the
issu
with
them
and
help
them
engag
more
deepli
with
the
campaign
i
saw
it
as
a
wast
of
preciou
time
that
i
could
be
use
to
get
more
signatur
i
wasn
’
t
encourag
peopl
to
connect
their
quick
action
to
the
bigger
pictur
and
think
through
the
reason
whi
these
injustic
are
happen
and
how
we
can
sometim
be
part
of
the
solut
to
the
problem
in
my
heart
it
didn
’
t
sit
right
that
the
action
i
wa
ask
peopl
to
do
were
so
easi
becaus
i
knew
that
the
easier
someth
is
the
less
we
are
like
to
reflect
on
it
take
ownership
of
our
action
and
we
might
even
forget
the
action
we
’
ve
just
taken
i
began
doubt
my
effect
as
an
activist
and
i
didn
’
t
find
it
fulfil
i
wa
wonder
whether
peopl
truli
care
about
an
issu
they
had
taken
action
on
and
the
small
level
of
commit
to
do
the
action
made
me
question
whether
custom
or
constitu
would
see
the
issu
as
someth
that
would
affect
their
consum
or
vote
choic
i
crave
a

wa
the
long

need

i
would
tri
and
work
on

but
would
feel
travel
sick
read
write
or
type
i
wa
look
around
a
shop
one
weekend
when
i
spot
a
small
squar
cross
stitch
kit
i
miss
paint
and
use
my
hand
to
make
thing
the
kit
wa
small
afford
and
fit
in
my
pocket
i
decid
to
take
it
on
my
next
train
journey
i
had
never
done
cross
stitch
befor
immedi
it
slow
me
down
becaus
i
had
to
read
the
instruct
so
that
i
didn
’
t
mess
up
it
requir
my
hand
and
head
to
work
togeth
in
a
way
i
hadn
’
t
ask
them
to
for
a
long
time
i
had
to
cut
the
thread
a
particular
length
the
length
from
my
index
finger
to
my
shoulder
so
that
it
wasn
’
t
too
long
and
wouldn
’
t
get
tangl
up
but
i
also
had
to
cut
it
so
that
it
wasn
’
t
too
short
or
i
would
be
give
myself
extra
work
rethread
it
i
learnt
that
embroideri
thread
is
differ
to
thread
for
a
sew
machin
you
get
6
strand
of
thread
in
each
embroideri
floss
the
american
term
and
you
choos
or
in
my
case
are
told
in
the
instruct
kit
to
use
the
optimum
amount
of
strand
that
complement
your
design
and
size
i
had
to
separ
my
thread
into
two
group
of
three
strand
the
first
time
i
separ
the
thread
felt
like
hour
becaus
i
wa
so
use
to
do
everyth
at
speed
i
need
to
give
it
my
full
attent
and
watch
the
thread
separ
unravel
and
i
had
to
make
sure
it
wasn
’
t
attach
to
anyth
that
might
caus
a
knot
i
had
to
let
the
thread
unravel
at
it
own
pace
i
natur
slow
down
to
count
the
number
of
cross
to
stitch
and
to
count
the
grid
pattern
on
the
fabric
to
see
where
to
start
the
stitch
i
had
to
make
sure
that
i
didn
’
t
pull
the
thread
so
tight
that
the
stitch
bunch
up
and
warp
the
design
i
am
faster
now
but
hand
embroideri
like
cross
stitch
cannot
be
too
rush
or
even
the
most
experienc
and
skill
person
will
make
mistak
with
everi
stitch
i
creat
i
felt
calmer
the
craft
kit
wa
access
for
beginn
like
me
but
it
wasn
’
t
so
easi
to
do
that
i
couldn
’
t
be
proud
of
my
effort
someth
click
in
me
stitch
could
be
the
tool
i
wa
look
for
to
help
me
develop
the
form
of
slow
activ
that
i
wa
crave
i
wa
learn
from
the
slow
movement
and
wa
now
look
to
incorpor
it
into
my
activ
i
want
to
join
thi
grow
movement
and
show
that
it
could
inform
and
enhanc
activ
the
slow
movement
not
onli
help
individu
live
a
healthier
and
more
enjoy
life
but
also
help
commun
creat
effect
ethic
and
attract
model
of
live
that
are
posit
influenc
our
cultur
it
’
s
not
about
do
everyth
at
a
snail
’
s
pace
but
rather
make
time
to
reflect
and
to
think
critic
about
at
what
pace
we
should
take
to
do
everyth
as
well
as
possibl
rather
than
just
as
fast
as
possibl
from
travel
to
cook
the
movement
is
gentli
protest
against
a
cultur
of
speed
size
and
surplu
it
is
challeng
the
notion
that
if
we
want
to
hang
on
to
our
job
stay
relev
and
be
valu
then
we

alongsid

take

make

harder

much
easier
to

when

they
becom
less
creativ
instead
of

up
with

we

keep
our

it
complet
right
as

we
should
be
kind
