the

i
wa
go
to
post
someth
about
thi
in
the
open
thread
but
thi
post
just
pop
up
i
ve
been
put
togeth
a
club
for
effect
altruism
on
my
campu
cavali
for
effect
altruism
and
i
m
stuck
i
can
run
fundrais
and
donat
the
money
to
a
chariti
givewel
support
my
colleg
ha
a
system
for
donat
to
chariti
and
fundrais
so
that
isn
t
a
problem
the
difficulti
is
get
other
peopl
interest
in
the
club
and
teach
my
club
member
ration
so
the
club
continu
exist
after
i
graduat
i
origin
thought
teach
peopl
ration
wouldn
t
be
necessari
but
the
coupl
friend
i
mention
thi
to
have
no
idea
what
i
m
talk
about
when
i
explain
how
effect
altruism
work
they
don
t
have
the
same
intuit
that
i
do
so
it
sound
odd
to
them
it
wa
around
then
i
realiz
that
i
need
my
club
member
to
know
some
ration
are
there
ani
resourc
guid
out
there
for
that
kind
of
thing
i
know
lesswrong
is
one
of
those
resourc
but
i
doubt
mani
peopl
will
listen
to
me
if
i
say
thi
week
s
club
homework
is
to
read
x
post
from
thi
blog
i
have
a
coupl
vagu
idea
for
slip
thi
inform
into
casual
convers
but
they
re
vagu
idea
and
it
s
hard
to
impart
enough
inform
through
casual
convers
anyway
i
think
i
could
tri
do
both
have
peopl
read
specif
articl
book
and
bring
it
up
in
casual
convers
but
that
bring
me
back
to
the
origin
problem
i
have
no
idea
how
to
teach
ration
and
peopl
don
t
respect
me
enough
to
listen
to
me
if
i
tell
them
they
need
to
know
someth
i
know
some
peopl
here
have
experi
in
teach
ration
so
i
m
fish
for
ani
advic
my
two
major
concern
are
how
to
bridg
the
infer
gap
between
myself
and
my
club
member
where
do
i
even
start
and
if
there
are
ani
other
way
to
teach
ration
beyond
the
two
i
mention

my

i
decid

idea
there

think
quantit
is
poor
shorthand
for
good
ration
practic
of
cours
a
rationalist
shouldn
t
neglect
quantit
thought
that
lead
to
fuzz
but
pure
quantit
evalu
is
just
as
bad
it
lead
to
no

style
teach

in

it

what

are
incred
easi
to

approv

for

is
a
tini
simpl

compar
to
plural

yet
would
elimin
a
number
of
senseless
bias
in
polit
and
polit
is
import
as
ani
evil
overlord
know
the
goal
is
to
take
over
the
world
but
it
s
veri
hard
to
quantifi
polit
progress
object
and
easi
to
get
into

kill
argument
so
it
seem
the
whole
issu
just
get
cover
by
an
ick
field
for
rationalist
so
the
question
becom
do
you
want
to
talk
about
what
aspir
effect
altruist
do
do
or
what
they
should
do
if
it
s
the
former
fine
if
it
s
the
latter
i
think
you
have
to
start
from
more

discuss

how

if
you

then
neg

disagre

onli
becaus

if

the

it

it

the

bia
is
necessari
for
bostrom
s

beckstead
s

so
there
s
weak
justif

your

the

make

it

by

bostrom

the
further

that

urgent
thi
seem

be
the

so
i

rather
go
for
someth
like
mani
some
ea

think
it
moral

therefor
the

urgenc
of
prevent

is
less

peopl
like

place
much
more

on
ensur
the

that

rather
than

make
as
mani

as

the
issu
is
not
whether
far
futur

as

closer

one
can
agre

yeah
i

i

the

is
the
more

conclus
than
the

the

suggest
that
the

is
most

i

nick
agre
that
the
time
issu
is
much
less

than
you
suggest
in

sorri
to
insist
but
when
you
disagre
with
bostrom
s

s

peopl
immedi
assum
that
you
must
be
valu
present
peopl
more
than

one
and
i
m
constantli
like
no
the
crucial
issu
is
whether
the

the

a

if
