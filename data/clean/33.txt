mani
that
common

with

can
lead
to

cooper

effect
altruism
can
teach
environment
to
take
it
motiv
back
and
pour
that
into

more

and
the
environmentalist
can
join

if

it

the

i
wa
go
to
post
someth
about
thi
in
the
open
thread
but
thi
post
just
pop
up
i
ve
been
put
togeth
a
club
for
effect
altruism
on
my
campu
cavali
for
effect
altruism
and
i
m
stuck
i
can
run
fundrais
and
donat
the
money
to
a
chariti
givewel
support
my
colleg
ha
a
system
for
donat
to
chariti
and
fundrais
so
that
isn
t
a
problem
the
difficulti
is
get
other
peopl
interest
in
the
club
and
teach
my
club
member
ration
so
the
club
continu
exist
after
i
graduat
i
origin
thought
teach
peopl
ration
wouldn
t
be
necessari
but
the
coupl
friend
i
mention
thi
to
have
no
idea
what
i
m
talk
about
when
i
explain
how
effect
altruism
work
they
don
t
have
the
same
intuit
that
i
do
so
it
sound
odd
to
them
it
wa
around
then
i
realiz
that
i
need
my
club
member
to
know
some
ration
are
there
ani
resourc
guid
out
there
for
that
kind
of
thing
i
know
lesswrong
is
one
of
those
resourc
but
i
doubt
mani
peopl
will
listen
to
me
if
i
say
thi
week
s
club
homework
is
to
read
x
post
from
thi
blog
i
have
a
coupl
vagu
idea
for
slip
thi
inform
into
casual
convers
but
they
re
vagu
idea
and
it
s
hard
to
impart
enough
inform
through
casual
convers
anyway
i
think
i
could
tri
do
both
have
peopl
read
specif
articl
book
and
bring
it
up
in
casual
convers
but
that
bring
me
back
to
the
origin
problem
i
have
no
idea
how
to
teach
ration
and
peopl
don
t
respect
me
enough
to
listen
to
me
if
i
tell
them
they
need
to
know
someth
i
know
some
peopl
here
have
experi
in
teach
ration
so
i
m
fish
for
ani
advic
my
two
major
concern
are
how
to
bridg
the
infer
gap
between
myself
and
my
club
member
where
do
i
even
start
and
if
there
are
ani
other
way
to
teach
ration
beyond
the
two

mention

think

poor
shorthand

practic
of

a
rationalist
shouldn
t
neglect
quantit
thought
that

pure

just

it

it

are

is
a

compar

yet
would
elimin
a

in

and
polit
is

know
the
goal
is

but
it
s
veri
hard
to

easi
to

kill

so
it
seem
the
whole
issu
just
get
cover
by
an

for

so
the
question
becom
do
you
want
to
talk
about
what
aspir
effect
altruist
do
do
or
what
they
should
do
if
it
s
the
former
fine
if
it
s
the

i

you
have
to

sorri
about

a

to

some
of

discuss

i

i

the

is
how

if
you
interpret
as
onli
posit

then
neg
utilitarian
disagre

onli
becaus
they

of

with

that

if
there

the

the

bia
is
necessari
for
bostrom
s

beckstead
s

so
there
s
weak
justif
for
your

the

make

it

by

suffici

bostrom

need
the
further

that

urgent
thi
seem

be
the

so
i

go

mani
some
ea

think
it

therefor
the

peopl

the

that

rather

as
mani

as

the
issu
is
not
whether
far
futur

as

closer

one
can
agre
that

the

okay
so
we
re
talk
about
two
point
1
whether
current
peopl
have
more
valu
than
futur
peopl
and
2
whether
it
would
be
super
good
to
creat
gazillion
of
super
good
live
my
sentenc
mention
both
of
those
in
sequenc
mani
ea
valu
futur
peopl
roughli
as
much
as
current
live
peopl
1
and
think
that
nearli
all
potenti
valu
is
found
in
the
well
be
of
the
astronom
number
of
peopl
who
could
popul
the
far
futur
2
and
you
are
suggest
what
that
i
switch
the
order
in
which
they
appear
so
that
2
appear
befor
1
and
is
thu
emphas
or
that
i
use
your
phrase
moral
urgent
to
instead
of
nearli
all

go
even
if

it
s
hardli
possibl
to

block
their

on

and

would
have
to
be
empir
e
g
base
on
the
claim
that

than
commonli

which
would
decreas
the
valu
of
x

by

if
you

1
it
s
still
veri
much
an
open
question
whether
you

also

not
an
issu
among
ea
the
idea
that
spatial

irrelev
when
it
come
to

is
a
pretti
core
element
of
the
ea
concept
what
is
an
issu
though
is
the
question
of
what
help
other
actual

who

person

how

these

there

and
if

it
s
even
more
import
to

it
clear
that

one
solut
could
be
to

if

believ

the

you
have
to
be
a
hufflepuff
to
want
to
help
you
have
to
be
a
ravenclaw
to
be
smart
enough
to
do
so
you
have
to
be
slytherin
to
realiz
what
you
can
do

i

you
have

2
you

3
you
