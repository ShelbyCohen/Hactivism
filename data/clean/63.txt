i
ask

whether
the

on
the
book
today
would
be
permit
under
hi
read
of
the
constitut
“
probabl
not

”
he
said
that
’

whi
barnett
and
hi
contemporari
prefer
to
root
their
argument
in
specif
injustic
rather
than
categor
abstract
whi

for

even
if
you
believ
these
regul
are
the
result
of
collus
between
govern
and
industri
croni
that
doesn

t
mean
they
should
be
constitut
prohibit
or
even
that
they
have
no
merit
onc
court
are
empow
to
invalid
sordid
govern
regul
they
are
also
on
a
slipperi
slope
to
toss
out
standard
that
serv
use
purpos
—
in

becaus
some

that

the

is
like
to
have

more
recours
—
and
would
have
govern
regul
to

that
’
s
not
a

rational
in
barnett
’
s
mind
“

he
told

emphat
“

”
the
ironi
of
thi
posit
should
be
lost
on
no
one
—
had
barnett

s
obamacar
challeng
succeed
16
million
fewer

today
the
movement
to

now
face
a
crucial
test
can
it
endur
after
the
spasm
of

to
the
obama
presid
have
quiet
or
will
it
burn
out
along
with
them
when
i
put
thi
question
to
barnett
he
demur
“
i
didn
’
t
realli
have
a
strategi
to
get
us
thi
far
”
he
said
nevertheless
barnett
believ
that
he
and
hi
contemporari
have
laid
a
solid
foundat
for
turn
back
the
legal
clock
to
lochner
“
i
don

barnett
said
of
the
overal
approach
“
you
don

that

whi
are

so

white

thi
is
a
question
that
jeet
heer
of
the

explor
last
friday
after
a

found
that
presidenti
hope
rand

who
happen
to
be
the
favorit
among
libertarian
is
veri
competit
in
the
primari
amongst

but
almost
complet
reject
by
femal
thi
is
a
problem
that
ha
long
haunt
conservat
but
it
is
even
more
drastic
for
ultra
right
wing
libertarian
in
a
2014
pew
poll
it
wa
found
that
about
one
in
ten
american
describ
themselv
as
libertarian
and
men
were
more
than
twice
as
like
to
be
libertarian
in
a
2013
pew

that
heer
state
in

articl
it
wa
found
about

68
percent
of
american
’

who
identifi
as

are

thi

who
were
found
to
be

and
87

or
“

found
to

accord
to
anoth
survey
done

clearli
the
entir
conserv

is
domin
by

but
libertarian
are
the
most

domin
obvious
thi
is
a
major
problem
for
anyon
who
is
hope
for
libertarian
to
take
off
in

so
whi
are
libertarian
mostli
white

heer
point
out
a
few
differ
possibl
that

that

tend

okay
so

attract

one
make

while
look

it
becom
a

more
clear
that
the

movement
in

tend
to
attract

who
want

in
hi
now
infam
interview
with
rachel
maddow
he
admit
that
he
had
a
major
problem
with
the
civil
right
act
of
1964
particularli
the
provis
that
“
harbor
in
on
privat
busi
and
their
polici
”
in
other
word
he
didn
’
t
like
the
govern
tell
busi
that
they
had
to
serv
black
peopl
accord
to
libertarian
thi
is
a
clear
violat
of
one
’
s
freedom
to
discrimin
that
if
a
busi
owner
doe
not
want
to
serv
a
black
person
that
is
their
right
of

thi
kind
of

is
go

libertarian

and

is
it
ani

if
we
take
a

a
similar
stori
present

last

a

found

wrote
the

maureen

thi

seem
to
confirm
that

against
the

there
are
cutthroat
strife
within

itself
between
the
more
