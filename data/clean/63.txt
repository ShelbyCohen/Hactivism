to

“

i
ask
barnett
whether

today
would
be
permit
under

read
of
the

“

”
he
said
that

whi
barnett

to
root
their

believ
these

are
the

they

even
that
they

onc

they

and
would

not

the

of

no

—

succeed
16

quiet
or
will
it
burn
out
along
with

when
i
put
thi
question
to
barnett
he
demur
“
i
didn

t
realli
have
a
strategi
to

thi
far
”
he
said
nevertheless
barnett
believ
that
he
and
hi
contemporari
have
laid
a
solid
foundat
for
turn
back
the
legal
clock
to

“

of

overal
approach
“

from

by
a
seri

libertarian
is
an
entir
“

movement
dedic
to
be
against

–
name
govern
in
thi
sens
libertarian
is
similar
to
new
atheism
anoth
movement
that
start
strong
about
ten
year
ago
and
end
up
buckl
and
splinter
over
time
just
like
atheist
are
unit
onli
in
opposit
to

libertarian
are
unit
onli
in
opposit
to
govern
–
and
it
is
difficult
to
build
a
posit
commun
around
a
neg
premis
regardless
of
the
legitimaci
of
the
neg
premis
but
the
contradict
in
libertarian
go
even
deeper
than
thi
a
polit
movement
for
liberti
is
a
fundament
oxymoron
consid
thi
polit
is
the
realm
in
which
we
debat
the
role
of

in
societi
everi

politician
at
each

of

pass
countless
law
and
the
gener
public
debat
about
whether
these

are
accept
these
debat
revolv
around
one
central
theme
what
is
the
role
of
govern
what
should
govern
do
and
what
should
it
not
do
these
question
occupi
the
attent
of
million
in
our
countri
alon
includ
politician
bureaucrat
and
polit
activist
if
libertarian
is
the
correct
philosophi
of
govern
then
all
of
thi
is
complet
irrelev
to
a
libertarian
the
big
question
are
answer
and
their
answer
are
veri
simpl
in
a
libertarian
societi
govern
exist
if
it
exist
at
all
to
protect
the
basic
right
of
it
citizen
to
life
liberti
and
properti
and
to
do
noth
els
besid
thi
the
onli
law
on
the
book
in
such
a
societi
are
law
that
protect
these
right
and
the
onli
crime
are
crime
that
involv
the
violat
of
these
right
govern
in
a
libertarian
societi
must
onli
provid
it
citizen
with
a
few
basic
servic
to
ensur
the
protect
of
these
right
–
polic
court
a
small
defens
militari
and
perhap
a
few
other
basic
common
good
such
as
fire
depart
and
road
okay
fine
mayb
we
can
privat
some
of
the
road
everyth
beyond
these
most
basic
servic
–
everyth
not
strictli
necessari
for
the
basic
stabil
of
societi
and
the
protect
of
individu
right
–
is
left
to
individu
and
corpor
i
do
not
want
to
sound
overli
disparag
of
thi
libertarian
vision
i
still
consid
myself

and
i
believ
that
such
a
world
would
in
most
way
be
superior
to
the
world
we
live
in
today
howev
the
realiz
of
thi

would
spell
doom
for
an
entir
class
of
peopl
the
polit
actor
of
our

whether
they
be

bureaucrat

would
becom
almost

almost
everyth
these

outsid
the

can

libertarian

of

what

do
libertarian
as

to

to

to
ludwig

and
their

the
“

such
as
john
lock
and
adam
smith
have
alreadi
said
almost
all
that
can
be
said
on
the
topic
can
anyon
make
the
case
for
libertarian
better
than
these
great
mind
have
do
we
realli
need
a
new
gener
of
austin
petersen
and
david
kokesh
to
reinvent
the
wheel
by
restat
all
their
argument
in
slightli
differ
word
we
have
littl
to
add
to
what
ha
alreadi
been
put
on
paper
of
cours
there
is
alway
room
for
critic
and
improv
but
onli
in
the
minutia
full
time
libertarian
activ
therefor
is
both
ultim
suicid
and
incred
bore
it
is
bore
becaus
it
provid
littl
to
no
intellectu
stimul
it
is
suicid
becaus
it
work
toward
it
own
obsolesc
is
it
ani
wonder
that
the
libertarian
movement
labor
under
these
inher
contradict
ha
made
so
littl
progress
the
specter
of
these
contradict
if
they
are
not
acknowledg
will
drive
the
libertarian
movement
to
full
ideolog
schizophrenia
…
if
inde
they
have
not
done
so
alreadi
we
might
critic
govern
bureaucrat
for
act
against
the
best
interest
of
the
public
by
creat
unnecessari
outgrowth
of
bureaucraci
with
which
to
occupi
themselv
at
public
expens
…
but
at
least
these
type
of
bureaucrat
are
act
in
their
person
best
interest
they
are
not
fundament
irrat
in
a
pervers
way
they
are
act
more
ration
than
libertarian
activist
are
becaus
they
are
work
to
creat
a
world
in
which
they
and
peopl
like
them
will
have
continu
relev
at
least
to
themselv
if
not
to
societi
when

weav
becam
obsolet
in
late
18th
centuri
england
the

weaver
rebel
and
smash
the
new

when
american
industri
began
to
be
outsourc

and
china
american
blue

worker
began
to
vote
for
protectionist
like
pat
buchanan
and
donald

everi
industri
on
the
verg
of
obsolesc
turn
to
luddism
and
protection
thi
is
a
sad
but
necessari
part
of
the
cycl
of
“
creativ
destruct
”
in
the
economi
we
can
expect
no
less
from
libertarian
activist
themselv
onc
polit
libertarian
start
to
becom
obsolet
render
thusli
by
it
own
success
it
adher
will
turn
to
their
own
brand
of
luddism
and
will
work
perhap
not
even
conscious
to
prolong
the
exist
of
big
govern
so
that
they
may
stay
relev
longer
like
the
joker
in
the
dark
knight
libertarian
activist
are
like
dog
chase
car
“
i
wouldn
’
t
know
what
to
do
with

if
i
caught
it
”
if
your
onli
market
skill
is
activ
then
you
will
not
thrive
in
a
world
that
no
longer
ha
need
of
your
activ
in
one
sens
thi
is
a
dilemma
common
to
activist
and
fighter
of
all
sort
not
just
libertarian
it
is
whi
socialist
movement
often
devolv
into
“
perman
revolut
”
and
endless
purg
and
counter
purg
until
the
cost
to
human
life
becom
unconscion
even
mose
wa
not
allow
to
enter
the

–
which
show
that
even
the
ancient
hebrew
were
awar
that
the
type
of
peopl
who
help
bring
about
a
better
world
are
not
necessarili
compat
with
the
type
of
peopl
who
will
inhabit
it
howev
becaus
of
it
inher
anti
govern
natur
thi
distinct
is
stronger
in
the
libertarian
movement
than
in
perhap
ani
other
social
movement
in
fact
one
could
argu
that
the
libertarian
movement
unconsci
awar
of
it
own
impend
obsolesc
ha
alreadi
begun
it
declin
into
intellectu
luddism
thi
may
be
the
reason
whi
the
libertarian
movement
of
late
ha
been
act
like
a
ship
without
a
rudder
candid
like
gari

abandon
basic
libertarian
principl
in
an
unsuccess
attempt
to
appeas
voter
on

while
the

seem
less
interest
in

the

tendenc
that

toward

to

certain
type
of

as
the
“

perhap
libertarian

have
start

long

thi
is

perhap
even
suicid
mistak
by

no

they
will
live
the
ideal
of
liberti
in

when

libertarian
should

anyth
beyond
thi

becom
at
