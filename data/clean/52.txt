i
’
m
not
nativ
but
i
want
to
give
my
opinion
on
thi
we
in
thi
countri
have
a
problem
the
major
of
peopl
in
thi
countri
don
’
t
vote
the
reason
is
for
the
same
reason
whi
nativ
have
gotten
short
chang
throughout
the
histori
of
thi
countri
and
mayb
it
time
for
a
chang
see
i
believ
that
govern
should
repres
everyon
we
should
all
be
consid
equal
under
it
and
have
equal
right
and
politician
should
be
held
to
the
same
law
that
everi
one
in
thi
countri
must
follow
i
don
’
t
think
that
thi
is
happen
in
thi
countri
i
don
’
t
think
it
ever
happen
and
that
to
me
make
me
sad
we
have
a
system
where
we
go
to
the
poll
and
elect
the
next
dictat
for
our
countri
that
dictat
is
allow
to
go
unchalleng
for
5
year
at
which
point
we
are
allow
to
go
back
to
the
poll
and
either
vote
in
anoth
dictat
or
keep
the
same
one
we
have
i
believ
that
politician
should
be
forc
to
not
onli
gain
support
of
the
major
they
should
be
forc
to
keep
it
at
all
time
that
would
fix
a
major
of
the
problem
we
have
with
our
govern
it
would
ensur
that
everyon
is
treat
equal
the
problem
is
the
politician
won
’
t
adher
to
such
rule
without
it
be
forc
on
them
they
don
’
t
want
anyon
to
tell
them
what
to
do
when
they
are
elect
least
of
all
your
averag
everyday
citizen
and
there
lie
the
problem
the
onli
way
to
fix
thi
is
bring
in
full
bind
referendum
and
recal
legisl
limit
their
power
emb
that
in
the
constitut
and
make
sure
it
can
never
be
chang
the
system
we
live
under
is
design
to
breed
corrupt
we
’
ve
seen
exampl
of
it
from
time
to
time
it
doesn
’
t
matter
if
it
a
liber
govern
a
conserv
govern
or
even
an
ndp
govern
they
all
want
to
be
at
the
public
trough
and
they
are
all
evil
in
their
own
way
it
thi
outdat
system
we
live
in
that
is
creat
thi
problem
a
system
that
’
s
been
twist
to
favour
the
rich
and
those
who
seek
power
and
ye
the
rich
for
sure
don
’
t
want
to
chang
it
they
benefit
from
it
the
most
so
what
do
we
do
we
have
to
band
togeth
in
solidar
both
nativ
and
non
nativ
we
need
to
find
a
way
to
chang
the
system
or
build
a
new
system
build
one
with
the
control
that
we
need
so
that
the
peopl
of
thi
countri
don
’
t

i
half
agre
with
just
my
2cent
and
wayn
the
peopl
who
are
the
leader
of
the
commun
should
be
more
respons
in
how
they
are
manag
or
mismanag
the
money
given
by
the
govern
i
think
the
govern
doe
owe
all
aborigin
peopl
for
the
past
wrong
do
but
at
the
same
time
aborigin
peopl
need
to
stop
use
the
govern
as
a
scapegoat
for
their
own
problem
if
a
leader
in
your
commun
is
prove
to
be
corrupt
then
work
toward
replac
them
with
someon
better
if
the
children
are
hungri
and
ill
educ
then
that
is
where
money
need
to
be
teach
young
girl
that
their
bodi
are
sacr
and
that
they
don
’
t
need
to
be
have
babi
with
boy
who
won
’
t
help
them
rather
encourag
the
young
peopl
to
have
self
respect
respect
for
each
other
and
to
go
to
school
so
that
when
they
choos
to
have
children
their
children
can
have
a
healthi
and
opportunist
futur
the
govern
can
be
use
as
a
method
of
us
as
a
peopl
to
help
ourselv
we
are
a
great
nation
still
mayb
the
major
are
lost
and
misguid
but
if
we
focu
on
develop
healthi
lifestyl
and
good
solid
educ
system
there
is
no
limit
what
we
can
achiev
we
just
need
to
stop
blame
other
nation
and
other
race
for
the
problem
we
are
face
now
ye
we
were
broken
and
abus
befor
but
that
cannot
be
chang
what
can
be
chang
is
how
we
progress
and
move
forward
with
our
live
and
with
our
commun
there
should
be
no
more
divis
between
variou
aborigin
group
at
the
veri
basi
of
it
all
we
are
all
human
we
are
all
part
of

earth
and
as
a
unifi
nation
we
can
protect
her
we
can
protect
our
famili
and
we
can
protect
our
futur
first
thing
that
need
to
be
done
is
peopl
must
open
their
eye
we
need
leader
who
will
have
the
entir
commun
in
their
focu
not
just
the
wallet
of
a
small
few
educ
for
the
children
and
protect
of
their
basic
need
food
shelter
safe
famili
environ
cloth
to
keep
them
warm
and
proper
healthcar
do
that
and
the
futur
will
improv
becaus
the
more
we
give
our
children
the
more
they
will
have
to
work
with
to
help
the
futur
of
the
nation
our
nation
of
great
and
power
aborigin
way
we
had
much
honour
befor
let
start
by
reviv
that
so
that
as
we
move

we
can
carri
our
