who
is
now
a

say
that
of
the
american
he
s
seen
come
to
work
on
the

he
manag
few
stick
around
for
more
than

it
s
not

the
physic
labor
that
s
problemat
it
s
the

and
migratori
natur
of
the

that
s

nassif

if

peopl
that
everi

they

the
onli
way
nassif
believ
american
worker
could
be

is
through
the

pick
robot
he
said
where
they
would
be
abl
to
put
their
higher
educ

he
note
that

nassif

ha
creat
a

california
to

like
these
the

also
bring
