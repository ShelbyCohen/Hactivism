that
she
didn

a

more

began

wa
at
thi
point
that

what
is

meant
by
thi
is
notion
that
who
a
person
sleep
with
how
they
dress
and
how
they
wear
their
hair
is
a
polit
statement
there
were
some
individu
within
the
movement
that
felt
that
in
order
to
be
a
true
feminist
that
they
had
to
refus
to
sleep
with
men
but
with
thi
notion
we
see
an
idea
that
is
onli
embrac
by
the
more
radic
and

faction
of

there
were
mani
thing
that
the

point
to
as
exampl
of
their
success
they
felt
that
one
success
wa
the
establish
of

which
gave
women
the
right
to

even
though
it

it
ha
gotten
through

remnant
of
it
continu

thi
day
anoth
success
of
the

be

although
titl
9
is
far
from
perfect
and

continu
to
thi
day
it
is
still
consid

nonetheless
if
we
analyz
the
histori
of

we
do
see
that
they
have
come
a
long

howev
as
is
the
case
in

there
is
no

statement
there
were
some

2
the
women
that
origin
form
now
felt
that
it
wa
veri
import
not
to
get
too
extrem
at
first
but
then
in
the
late
1960
younger
group
start
to
emerg
although
have
the
back
of
a
sizeabl
group
of
young
peopl
is
consid
to
be
a
good
thing
for
ani
movement
the
fact
that
friedan
and
her
fellow
co
founder
of
now
were
all
from
the
wwii
gener
and
the
newer
group
that
were
join
the

had
much
differ

a
clash
within
the
movement
one
exampl
of
a
clash
took
place
dure
the
1968
mr

pageant
when
the
new

radic
women
n
y
r
w
decid
to
protest
the
event
one
of
the
member
got
metal
trash
can
and
threw
item
that
they
consid
to
be
object
of
femal
tortur
such
as
bra
pot
pan
and
copi
of
ladi
home
journal
and
threw
them
into
the
can
friedan
wa
furiou
about
these
action
she
felt
that
action
such
as
these
would
prevent
peopl
from
take
their
movement
serious
in
the
view
of
the
newer
gener
friedan
wa
for
maintain
the
statu
quo
she
want
women
to
wear
makeup
and
dress
and
to
look
a
certain
way
the
newer
gener
disagre
with
these
desir
friedan
also
state
that
she
didn
t
want
peopl
to
think
that
now
wa
just
a
bunch
of
lesbian
the
fact
wa
howev
that
a
great
deal
of
the
younger
peopl
that
were
particip
in
the
women
’
s
movement
were
inde
lesbian
disagr
over
polici
caus
an
inevit
split
within
the
organ
in
the
late
1970
that
almost
result
in
the
destruct
of
the
organ
more
conserv
member
of
the
organ
began
expel
the
more
radic
member
it
wa
at
thi
point
that
lesbian
women
began
to
pursu
their
own
interest
to
mani
lesbian
wa
about
separat
and
the
creation
of

began
to

propos
an
all
femal

the
refrain
for
mani
wa
“
person
is
polit
”
and
what
is
supposedli
meant
by
thi
is
notion
that
who
a
person
sleep
with
how
they
dress
and
how
they
wear
their
hair
is
a
polit
statement
there
were
some
individu
within
the
movement
that
felt
that
in
order
to
be
a
true
feminist
that
they
had
to
refus
to
sleep
with
men
but
with
thi
notion
we
see
an
idea
that
is
onli
embrac
by
the
more
radic
and
extrem
faction
of
the
women
’
s
movement
there
were
mani
thing
that
the
women
’
s
movement
point
to
as
exampl
of
their
success
they
felt
that
one
success
wa
the
establish
of
roe
vs

which
gave
women
the
right
to
choos
abort
as
an
option
anoth
success
wa
the
equal
right

which
wa
meant
as
a
logic
extens
to
women

s
suffrag
and
even
though
it
ha
yet
to
be
pass
it
ha
gotten
through
both
the
hous
and
the
senat
and
remnant
of
it
continu
to
thi
day
anoth
success
of
the
women
’
s
movement
could
be
titl
9
which
call
for
women
to
have
equal
opportun
in
colleg
sport
although
titl
9
is
far
from
perfect
and
convers
continu
to
thi
day
it
is
still
consid
success
nonetheless
if
we
analyz
the
histori
of
the
women
’

movement
we
do
see
that
they
have
come
a
long
way
howev
as
is
the
case
in
ani
other
polit
movement
there
is
no
question
that
they
still
have
a
long

friedan
also
state
that
she
didn

want
peopl
to

the
fact
wa

that
a

that
were

more
conserv
member
of
the
organ
began
expel

it
wa
at
thi
point
that
lesbian

began
to
pursu
their

the
creation

for

“

what
is

meant
by
thi
is
notion
that
who
a
person
sleep
with
how
they
dress
and
how
they
wear
their
hair
is
a
polit
statement
there
were
some
individu
within
the
movement
that
felt
that
in
order
to
be
a
true
feminist
that
they
had
to
refus
to
sleep
with
men
but
with
thi
notion
we
see
an
idea
that
is
onli
embrac
by
the
more
radic

there
were
mani
thing
that
the

point
to
as
exampl
of
their
success
they
felt
that
one
success
wa
the
establish
of

which
gave
women
the
right

wa
meant

even
though
it
ha
yet
to
be
pass
it
ha
gotten
through

remnant
of
it
continu

success
of

if

desir
friedan
also
state
that
she
didn

want
peopl
to

the
fact

that
a

of

peopl
that
were

were

more
conserv
member
of
the
organ
began
expel

it
wa
at
thi
point
that
lesbian

began
to
pursu
their

the
creation

the
refrain
for
mani
wa
“

”
and
what
is
supposedli
meant
by
thi
is
notion
that
who
a
person
sleep
with
how
they
dress
and
how
they
wear
their
hair
is
a
polit
statement
there
were
some
individu
within
the
movement
that
felt
that
in
order
to
be
a
true
feminist
that
they
had
to
refus
to
sleep
with
men
but
with
thi
notion
we
see
an
idea
that
is
onli
embrac
by
the
more
radic
and
extrem
faction
of
the

movement
there
were
mani
thing
that
the
women
’

movement
point
to
as
exampl
of
their
success
they
felt
that
one
success
wa
the
establish
of
roe

which
gave
women
the
right
to
choos

as
an
option

which
wa
meant
as
a

even
though
it
ha
yet
to
be
pass
it
ha
gotten
through
both
the
hous
and
the
senat
and
remnant
of
it
continu

thi
day
anoth
success
of
the

could
be

titl
9
is
far

it

nonetheless
if

have
come

there
is
no
