”
exampl
of
incorrect
usag
“

”
it
’
s
nice
to
be
welcom
but
there
’
s
no
such
thing
as
a
“
neurodivers
person
”
the
correct
phrase
here
would
be
“
autist

”
“
thi

open

both
neurotyp

the
neurodivers
”
no
no
no
“
the

”
serious
what
doe
that
even
mean
the
spectrum
of
neurodivers
encompass
the
entir
human
speci
so
one
can
’
t
label
ani
subset
of
the
human
speci
as
“
the
neurodivers
”
and
neurotyp
are
part
of
the
spectrum
of
human
neurodivers
so
it
make
no
sens
to
say
“
neurotyp
and
the
neurodivers
”
as
if
those
were
two
separ
thing
the
correct
way
to
say
thi
would
be
“
thi
group
is
open
to
both
neurotyp
and
the
neurodiverg
”
or
one
could
say
someth
like
“
thi
group
is
open
to
all
form
of
neurodivers
”
“
all
form
of
neurodivers
”
would
includ
the
neurocognit
style
of
all
human
includ
neurotyp
exampl
of
possibl
correct
usag
“
the
student
in
thi
classroom
are
neurodivers
”
thi
is
correct
usag
if
the
speaker
mean
that
not
all
of
the
student
in
the
classroom
share
the
same
gener
style
of
neurocognit
function
howev
it
is
incorrect
usag
if
what
the
speaker
is
tri
to
say
is
that
it
’
s
a
classroom
for
student
who
aren
’
t
neurotyp
–
if
that
’
s
the
case
then
onc
again
the
correct
term
would
be
neurodiverg
instead
of

i

autist
claim
that
there
is
a
consensu
among
most

not
all
autist

that
find
a

would
be
a
horribl
thing
autism
is
a
part
of
who
they
are
and
to
take
away
the
autism
is
to
take
away
the
person
they
go
further
to
claim
that
autism
is
not
realli
a
disord
but
just
a
differ

of
brain
wire
some
call
thi
philosophi
neurodivers
some
of
them
do
acknowledg
that
autism
is
a
disabl
howev
there
is
a
distinct
between
a
medic
model
of
disabl
wherein
the
person
ha
a
diseas
state
and
the
social
model
of
disabl
the

at

8
year
veteran
of
special

yet
i
do
not
share
thi
view
i
long
for
a
cure
for
autism
though
a
cure
at
age
52
is
not
the
same
as
at
age
3
even
in
the
unlik
event
of
a
cure
be
found
in
my
lifetim
somehow
i
got
miss
when
they
took
the
censu
so
they
are
incorrect
about
all
or
most
autist
is
thi
a
viabl
philosophi
that
will
help
autist
and
their
famili
is
there
a
consensu
for
thi
philosophi
among
most
autist
person
are
the
peopl
who
espous
thi
philosophi
typic
of
autist
peopl
in
gener
i
would
like
to
address
these
question
in
thi
piec
my
problem
are
mani
i
have
been
fire
from
multipl
job
and
had
to
retir
from
paid
work
at
51
i
am
52
now
i
have
never
had
a
girlfriend
sometim
i
would
make
abov
averag
error
at
work
though
there
wa
some
discrimin
as
well
thi
doe
not
fit
in
with
neurodivers
s
solut
of
accommod
is
it
moral
justifi
to
forc
a
woman
to
have
sex
with
me
and
other
social
starv
autist
is
discrimin
the
same
as
sexual
disinterest
these
are
issu
that
neurodivers
can
t
seem
to
reconcil
i
also
have
problem
appli
myself
and
stay
on
task
which
ha
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
do
mani
thing
i
want
to
do
like
learn
comput
program
and
about
comput
and
do
more
write
and
do
requisit
research
for
certain
type
of
write
it
ha
also
given
me
perceptu
motor
impair
and
bad
handwrit
impair
what
do
these
thing
have
to
do
with
societ
accommod
what
about
person
like
dov
shestack
russel
rollen
and
less
high
profil
sever
autist
peopl
who
can
t
talk
and
bang
their
head
against
wall
how
will
societ
chang
stop
these
behavior
neurodivers
just
claim
that
someth
should
be
done
about
it
but
they
alway
seem
to
come
up
short
of
suggest
what
about
the
fact
that
mani
though
not
as
mani
as
onc
thought
perhap
autist
person
can
t
speak
facilit
commun
is
given
as
the
answer
in

case
but
thi
unproven
techniqu
even
assum
it
could
be
use
for
everi
nonverb
autist
certainli
is
not
the
same
as
normal

and
would
not
enabl
them
to

at
the

level
as
a
normal

person
i
am
an

i
have
the
right
to
my
own
bodi
i
have
a
right
not
to
be
cure
if
there
is
a
cure
avail
thi
might
be
a
respons
from
a
neurodivers
person
but
the
problem
with
thi
is
that
a
number
of
these
peopl
who
preach
these
idea
say
that
autism
is
onli
a
differ
are
often
on
ssi
or
are
client
of
state
region
center
or
have
other
taxpay
provid
servic
for
them
becaus
they
have
a
disabl
thi
inconsist
is
frequent
reconcil
by
put
into
forc
the
social
model
of
disabl
argument
they
have
difficulti
find
good
autist
role
model
to
foster
their
argument
with
the
possibl
except
of
someon
like
templ
grandin
so
they
resort
to
argument
claim
that
bill
gate
is
autist
and
that
if
autism
had
been
cure
when
gate
wa
a
toddler
he
would
not
have
been
abl
to
accomplish
all
of
hi
great
thing
they
use
histor
figur
like
einstein
and
thoma
jefferson
and
isaac
newton
to
claim
autism
is
someth
great
and
should
not
be
cure
the
problem
with
diagnos
some
of
these
peopl
ha
been
dealt
with
in
an
essay
i
wroteundiagnos
gate
jefferson
and
einstein
and
the
interest
person
who
happen
to
read
thi
can
be
refer
to
my
essay
for
more
on
the
matter
one
of
the
person
who
espous
thi
argument
claim
that
autism
equal
geniu
and
great
when
he
himself
is
appar
incap
of
even
hold
down
a
minimum
wage
job
and
is
on
the
dole
one
young
angri
autist
femal
even
goe
as
far
as
claim
that
person
desir
a
cure
for
autism
are
respons
for
the
murder
of
kati
mccarron
a
3
year
old
autist
girl
who
wa
brutal
murder
by
her
mother
when
her
mother
could
not
deal
with
her
autism
and
other
autist
toddler
who
were
senselessli
murder
by
their
parent
i
do
find
thi
reason
insult
insinu
that
i
am
even
in
an
indirect
manner
respons
for
a
small
autist
child
s
murder
anoth
strawman
argument
is
that
cure
and
prevent
are
in
realiti
code
word
for
abort
and
one
offens
cartoon
on
the
web
page
autist
org
impli
thi
line
of
think
the
onli
reason
that
genet
research
is
done
on
autism
is
the
intent
of
deliber
find
a
way
of
abort
autist
fetus
of
cours
it
would
never
occur
to
them
that
someon
might
want
to
find
a
way
to
delet
or
insert
certain
gene
to
avoid
the
effect
of
a
mutat
that
would
caus
the
child
to
have
grave
harm
throughout
their
life
are
these
peopl
typic
of
autist
peopl
is
there
a
consensu
among
person
on
the
autist
spectrum
on
thi
point
of
view
someon
can
claim
that
they
took
a
survey
show
that
99
9
of
american
are
in
favor
of
complet
overturn
roe
versu
wade
support
mike
huckabe
or
possibl
pat
robertson
for
presid
in
2008
the
problem
is
the
survey
wa
taken
in
a
small
neighborhood
in
biloxi
mississippi
i
believ
that
thi
is
analog
to
claim
almost
all
autist
believ
in
neurodivers
the
internet
ha
given
a
medium
in
which
a
small
vocal
minor
can
espous
their
opinion
and
make
it
look
like
they
are
a
much
bigger
group
than
they
are
most
person
with
an
autism
spectrum
disord
have
never
had
a
web
page
or
have
express
their
opinion
in
the
comment
section
of
someon
s
blog
and
never
will
they
don
t
have
the
intellectu
inclin
to
do
such
a
thing
i
am
not
tri
to
speak
for
ani
person
with
autism
other
than
myself
i
also
notic
that
mani
of
them
were
not
diagnos
until
they
were
adult
some
have
marri
and
some
have
kid
with
one
except
none
of
them
have
to
the
best
of
my
knowledg
ever
been
in
a
special
educ
set
as
i
have
the
one
except
is
someon
who
wa
abl
to
talk
as
a
child
and
then
allegedli
lost
her
speech
as
an
adult
some
person
on
anoth
web
site
have
even
accus
thi
person
of
be
a
fraud
though
i
don
t
know
whether
or
not
she
is
a
fraud
it
doe
seem
unusu
for
someon
to
be
abl
to
speak
as
a
toddler
and
then
lose
the
speech
as
an
adult
and
have
to
use
a
commun
thi
doe
rais
some
question
it
is
between
age
18
and
36
month
that
an
autist
person
will
lose
their
speech
not
as
an
adolesc
or
in
late
childhood
or
adulthood
anoth
thing
that
come
to
my
attent
is
that
a
disproportin
number
of
them
are
femal
it
seem
as
mani
or
more
femal
than
male
are
claim
to
be
autist
with
a
neurodivers
inclin
thi
is
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
literatur
on
autism
ha
consist
shown
the
condit
to
have
a
4
to
1
ratio
of
male
to
femal
the
ratio
may
be
as
high
as
10
to
1
in
the
higher
function
group
accord
to
some
studi
a
clich
argument
among
allegedli
autist
neurodivers
femal
is
that
autism
is
underdiagnos
in
femal
femal
are
not
as
aggress
they
are
more
inclin
to
be
social
than
boy
and
can
pass
more
easili
so
they
are
not
as
often
diagnos
interestingli
thi
is
the
same
argument
that
ivar
lovaa
and
tristram
smith
use
to
explain
the
sex
ratio
discrep
in
their
control
group
versu
the
experiment
group
in
the
studi
on
aba
in
autism
one
of
the
problem
with
thi
argument
is
that
similar
ratio
are
found
in
other
development
disabl
such
as
dyslexia
and
stutter
and
not
just
in
autism
how
doe
one
explain
underdiagnos
of
femal
stutter
base
on
the
social
argument
or
be
abl
to
pass
i
am
a
male
lost
speech
at

regain
it
befor
age

special

alumnu
i
believ
that
i
am
more
repres
of
at
least
the
vast
major
of
person
who
preach
neurodivers
as
the
answer
and
i
want
a
cure
though
i
realiz
that
it
is
improb
there
will
be
one
in
my
lifetim
the
neurodivers
are
not
dissimilar
to
christian
missionari
who
go
out
and
tri
to
convert
lost
soul
they
can
often
reach
a
vulner
audienc
as
mani
person
on
the
spectrum
have
been
disaffect
from
societi
they
feel
worthless
and
have
low
self
esteem
and
neurodivers
provid
a
tempt
escap
valv
the
same
is
true
for
parent
of
sometim
sever
autist
children
who
want
to
see
their
offspr
as
someth
other
than
defici
or
broken
some
of
these
parent
themselv
end
up
decid
they
themselv
are
on
the
spectrum
out
of
the
clear
blue
sky
well
into
adulthood
though
sometim
diagnos
by
a
clinician
at

allegedli
the
problem
is
the

is
still
there
the
problem
are
still
there
they
will
never
go
away
or
be
prevent
if
a
neurodivers
attitud
is
taken
i
hope
that
if
ani
person
touch
by
autism
happen
to
read
thi
and
someon
from
the
neurodivers
crowd
give
them
a
