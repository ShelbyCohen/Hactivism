the

is
‘

that
is
good
in
some
peopl
experi
they
have
been
pull

and
the
polic
have
not

the
train
to
even
know
how
to
recognis
those
on

not
that
obviou
to
the
untrain

…
so
educ
and
ask
question
be
awar
that
is
a
possibl
in
our
societi
today
is
a
must
i
know
of
quit
a

peopl

they

of

the
differ
is
learn

way
in

what

misus
the
term
neurodivers
to
mean
neurodiverg
i
e
non
neurotyp
is
not
onli
plain
old
bad
english
it
also
subtli
reinforc
ableism
and
undercut
the
fundament
tenet
of
the
neurodivers
paradigm
i
hope
thi
explan
will
help
to
encourag
peopl
especi
peopl
who
identifi
as
propon
of
the
neurodivers
paradigm
or
support
of
the
neurodivers
movement
to
avoid
thi
problemat
misus
of
the
term
neurodivers
in
the
futur
and
when
possibl
to
correct
such
misus
where
they
encount
it
exampl
of
correct
usag
“
we
human
are
a
neurodivers
speci
”
“
we
employ
a
wide

of

”
“
my
neurodivers
famili
includ
three
neurotyp
two
autist
and
one
person
who
’
s
both
bipolar
and
dyslex
”
“
i
think
everi
singl
member
of
their
board
of
director

neurotyp
an
organ
that
supposedli
serv
the
need
of
neurominor
children
should
have
a
more
neurodivers
board
”
exampl
of
incorrect
usag
“
thi
group
welcom
autist
and
other
neurodivers
peopl
”
it
’
s
nice
to
be
welcom
but
there
’
s
no
such
thing
as
a
“
neurodivers
person
”
the
correct
phrase
here
would
be
“
autist
and
other
neurodiverg
peopl
”
“
thi
group
is
open
to
both
neurotyp
and
the
neurodivers
”
no
no
no
“
the
neurodivers
”
serious
what
doe
that
even
mean
the
spectrum
of
neurodivers
encompass
the
entir
human
speci
so
one
can
’
t
label
ani
subset
of
the
human
speci
as
“
the
neurodivers
”
and
neurotyp
are
part
of
the
spectrum
of
human
neurodivers
so
it
make
no
sens
to
say
“
neurotyp
and
the
neurodivers
”
as
if
those
were
two
separ
thing
the
correct
way
to
say
thi
would
be
“
thi
group
is
open
to
both
neurotyp
and
the
neurodiverg
”
or
one
could
say
someth
like
“
thi
group
is
open
to
all
form
of
neurodivers
”
“
all
form
of
neurodivers
”
would
includ
the
neurocognit
style
of
all
human
includ
neurotyp
exampl
of
possibl
correct
usag
“
the
student
in
thi
classroom
are
neurodivers
”
thi
is
correct
usag
if
the
speaker
mean
that
not
all
of
the
student
in
the
classroom
share
the
same
gener
style
of
neurocognit
function
howev
it
is
incorrect
usag
if
what
the
speaker
is
tri
to
say
is
that
it
’
s
a
classroom
for
student
who
aren
’
t
neurotyp
–
if
that
’
s
the
case
then
onc
again
the
correct
term
would
be
neurodiverg
instead
of
neurodivers
i
hope
thi
list
of
definit
will
help

greater
clariti
