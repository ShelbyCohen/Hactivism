six
key
principl
first
one
can
resist

without

seek
to
win
the
‘‘
friendship
and

of

84
third
evil

fourth
those
commit

must
be
will
to

can

fifth
nonviol
resist
avoid
‘‘
extern
physic
violenc
’’
and
‘‘
intern
violenc

as
well
‘‘
the

onli
refus

but
he
also
refus

him
’’
king
stride
85
the
resist
should
be
motiv
by
love

the
sens
of

the
sixth
principl
is
that
the
nonviol

must
have
a
‘‘
deep
faith
in

stem
from
