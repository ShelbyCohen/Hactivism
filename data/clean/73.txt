are

1
they
all

2
the
form
of

is
one
of

form
that

factor
in
their
psych

and
fundament
way
of
relat

the
world
3
the
form
of
neurodiverg
they
share
is
one
to
which
the
neurotyp
major
tend
to
respond
with
some
degre
of
prejudic
misunderstand
discrimin
and
or
oppress
often
facilit
by
classifi
that
form
of
neurodiverg
as
a
medic
patholog
some
exampl
of
neurominor
group
includ
autist
bipolar
dyslex
and
schizophren
peopl
the
word
neurominor
can
function
as
either
a
noun
“
autist
are
a
neurominor
”
or
an
adject
“
autist

group
”
neurodivers
what
it
mean
a
group
of
peopl
is
neurodivers
if
one
or
more
member
of
the
group
differ
substanti
from
other
member
in
term
of
their
neurocognit
function
or
to
phrase
it
anoth
way
a
neurodivers
group
is
a
group
in
which
multipl
neurocognit
style
are
repres
thu
a
famili
the
faculti
or
student
bodi
of
a
school
the
popul
of
a
town
or
the
cast
of
charact
of
a
tv
show
would
be
neurodivers
if
some
member
had
differ
neurocognit
style
from
other
member
–
for
instanc
if
some
member
were
neurotyp
while
other
were
autist
what
it
doesn
’
t
mean
mani
peopl
mistakenli
use
neurodivers
where
the
correct
word
would
be
neurodiverg
of
all
the
terminolog
error
that
peopl
make
in
write
and
speak
about
neurodivers
the
incorrect
use
of
neurodivers
to
mean
neurodiverg
is
by
far
the
most
common
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
“
neurodivers
individu
”
the
correct
term
is
“
neurodiverg
individu
”
an
individu
can
diverg
but
an
individu
cannot
be
divers
divers
is
a
properti
of
group
not
of
individu
that
’
s
intrins
to
the
mean
and
proper
usag
of
the
term
divers
group
are
divers
individu
diverg
in
addit
neurodivers
doe
not
mean
“
non
neurotyp
”
the
opposit
of
neurotyp
is
neurodiverg
not
neurodivers
the
opposit
of
neurodivers
would
be
neurohomogen
mean
“
compos
of
peopl
who
are
all
neurocognit
similar
to
one
anoth
”
neurodivers
cannot
be
use
to
mean
“
non
neurotyp
”
becaus
neurotyp
peopl
like
all
other
human
be
are
part
of
the
spectrum
of
human
neurodivers
in
north
america
europ
and
australia
white
peopl
are
the
racial
group
that
hold
the
most
privileg
and
societ
power
but
we
do
not
use
the
term
“
racial
divers
”
to
mean
“
non
white
”
“
racial

”
mean
“
includ
member
of
multipl

”
to
use
the
term
“
racial

to
mean
“
non
white
”
or
to
describ
a
black
or
asian
american
person
for
instanc
as
a
“
racial
divers
individu
”
would
not
mere
be
an
incorrect
usag
of
the
word
“
divers
”
–
it
would
also
be
racist
it
would
be
racist
becaus
it
would
impli
that
white
peopl
somehow
occupi
a
special

posit

of
human
–
“
there

s
us
white
peopl

then
there
are
all
those

”
such
usag
chang
the
definit
of
the
word
“
divers
”
to
mean
“
not
part
of
the
privileg
in
group
”
again
that
’
s
not
what
the
word
mean
and
misus
it
in
that
particular
way
serv
to
reinforc
a
racist
mindset
in
which
white
peopl
are
seen
as
intrins
separ
from
the
rest
of
human
rather
than
as
just
anoth
part
of

of

divers
it
is
the
same
with
the
misus
of
the
term
neurodivers
to
mean
“
non
neurotyp
”
to
describ
an
autist
bipolar
or
otherwis
neurodiverg
person
as
a
“

”
is
not
mere
an
incorrect
usag
of
the
word
“

”
it
’
s
also
ableist
it

becaus
it

to

in

futur

when
possibl
to

where
they
encount

that

children

board
”
exampl
of
incorrect
usag
“
thi

welcom
autist

other
neurodivers
peopl
”
it
’
s
nice
to
be
welcom
but
there
’
s
no
such
thing
as
a
“
neurodivers
person
”
the
correct
phrase
here
would
be
“
autist
and
other
neurodiverg
peopl
”
“
thi
group
is
open
to
both
neurotyp
and
the
neurodivers
”
no
no
no
“
the
neurodivers
”
serious
what
doe
that
even
mean
the
spectrum
of
neurodivers
encompass
the
entir
human
speci
so
one
can
’
t
label
ani
subset
of
the
human
speci
as
“
the
neurodivers
”
and
neurotyp
are
part
of
the
spectrum
of
human
neurodivers
so
it
make
no
sens
to
say
“
neurotyp
and
the
neurodivers
”
as
if
those
were
two
separ
thing
the
correct
way
to
say
thi
would
be
“
thi
group
is
open
to
both
neurotyp
and
the
neurodiverg
”
or
one
could
say
someth
like
“
thi
group
is
open
to
all
form
of
neurodivers
”
“
all
form
of
neurodivers
”
would
includ
the
neurocognit
style
of
all
human
includ
neurotyp
exampl
of
possibl
correct
usag
“
the
student
in
thi
classroom
are
neurodivers
”
thi
is
correct
usag
if
the
speaker
mean
that
not
all
of
the
student
in
the
classroom
share
the
same
gener
style
of
neurocognit
function
howev
it
is
incorrect
usag
if
what
the
speaker
is
tri
to
say
is
that
it
’
s
a
classroom
for
student
who
aren
’
t
neurotyp
–
if
that
’
s
the
case
then
onc
again
the
correct
term
would
be
neurodiverg
instead
of
neurodivers
i

thi
