you

let

crunch
the
number
to
see
whi
activ

such
a
crucial
task
the
number
of
live
you
can
save
through
be

is
pretti
much
limit
by
the
amount
of
meat
milk
and
egg
that
one
person
can
eat
that
obvious
vari
by
person
but
thi
rigor
estim
calcul
that
the
averag
vegetarian
save
about
25
anim
per
year
so
let
’
s
keep
the
math
simpl
and
say
all
vegetarian
live
to
100
and
therefor
save
2500
anim
over
their
lifetim
in
contrast
to
the
2500
anim
your

can
save
there
’
s
no
upper
limit
to
the
number
of
anim
your
activ
can
save
everi
littl
effort
you
make
and
everi
behavior
chang
that
result
make
a
differ
and
the
number
quickli
add
up
if
you
convinc
a

to
cut
her
meat
intak
in
half
that
’
s
twelv
anim
you
’
ve
save
everi

for
the

of
your

if
you
persuad
someon
to
stop

chicken
that
’

probabl
go
to
save
about
twenti
anim
per

move
forward
and
don

forget
that
even

often
lead

tomorrow
oftentim
you
will
never

the

the
