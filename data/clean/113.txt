i
will
make
my
comment
without

so
that
peopl
who
haven
t
yet
seen
the
movi
can
read
it
one
of
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
in
a
sequel
to
a
success
movi
is
that
audienc
will
feel
like
they
re
see
the
same
movi
again
with
slight
variat
on
the
theme
dead
man
s
chest
give
us
all
the
charact
we
love
in
the
first
movi
but
put
them
in
a
refreshingli
origin
movi
the
action
sequenc
will
keep
you
on
the
edg
of
your
seat
and
there
are
more
laugh
out
loud
moment
in
thi
movi
than
in
most
comedi
i
felt
entertain
from
the
begin
right
through
to
the
special
scene
after
the
close
credit
in
fact
i
enjoy
it
so
much
that
i
and
my
entir
famili
will
be
go
to
see
it
again
today
for
parent
with
young
children
thi
movi
is
more
violent
than
the
first
movi
there
is
a
lot
of
kill
though
none
of
it
is
shown
close
up

as
a
sequel
it
had
much
to
live
up
to
the
glori
of
the
first
film
and
person
i
thought
it
had
done
rather
well
the
special
effect
on
bill
nighi
davey
jone
and
hi
pirat
crew
wa
perhap
the
best
it
wa
veri
realist
the
movi
had
a
bit
of
a
slow
start
but
overal
wa
a
wonder
film
johnni
depp
did
well
in
hi
portray
of
captain
jack
sparrow
as
previous
in
the
first
film
keira
knightley
and
bill
nighi
were
also
of
mention
perform
i
thought
orlando
bloom
wa
a
littl
wooden
as
i
thought
of
hi
perform
in
the
first
film
but
still
believ
and
he
manag
to
pull
it
off
the
end
which
wa
rather
interest
serv
it
purpos
in
suspens
it
left
the
audienc
hang
and
it
also
left
me
hang
in
a
buzz
of
question
i
m
extrem
eager
to
see
the
next
pirat
of
caribbean
film
howev
the
film
did
contain
quit
a
number
of
refer
to
the
first
film
the
curs
of
the
black
pearl
and
i
advis
you
to
recap
your
knowledg
of
the
first
film
and
re
watch
it
to
get
the
gist
overal
i
believ
the
second
pirat
of
carribbean
wa
a
rather
good
film
and
veri
success
in
standard
of
sequel
i
can
t

i
will
make
my
comment
without
spoiler
so
that
peopl
who
haven
t
yet
seen
the
movi
can
read
it
one
of
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
in
a
sequel
to
a
success
movi
is
that
audienc
will
feel
like
they
re
see
the
same
movi
again
with
slight
variat
on
the
theme
dead
man
s
chest
give
us
all
the
charact
we
love
in
the
first
movi
but
put
them
in
a
refreshingli
origin
movi
the
action
sequenc
will
keep
you
on
the
edg
of
your
seat
and
there
are
more
laugh
out
loud
moment
in
thi
movi
than
in
most
comedi
i
felt
entertain
from
the
begin
right
through
to
the
special
scene
after
the
close
credit
in
fact
i
enjoy
it
so
much
that
i
and
my
entir
famili
will
be
go
to
see
it
again
today
for
parent
with
young
children
thi
movi
is
more
violent
than
the
first
movi
there
is
a
lot
of
kill
though
none
of
it
is
shown
close
up
or
in
a
grisli
manner
davey
jone
and
hi
gang
are
veri
gross

one
of
the
fishermen
is
talk
in
turkish
the
other
one
is
talk
in
greek
albeit
in
the
greek
cypriot
dialect
the
greek
cypriot

want
the

and
that
the
other
fisherman
should
have
it
the
word
the
greek
cypriot
fisherman
use
for
dandi
is
an
anachron
sinc
the
word
magka

19th
centuri
some
sourc
claim
earlier
but
nevertheless
back
then
it
refer
to
a
specif
kind
of
social
outcast
it
therefor
had
a
neg
mean
in
the
20th
centuri
the
mean
of
magka
kept
chang
with
each
gener
and
it
wasn
t
until
the
late
20th
centuri
that
the
word
magka
wa
also
use
when
refer
to
a
dandi
it
other
contemporari
mean
is
that
of
a
fearless
person
what
mark
did
jack
leav

the
answer
to
thi
question
is
never
reveal
but
the
possibl
are
1
jack
cut
beckett
dure
a
sword
fight
leav
him
with
a
hideou
scar

see
as
how
hubri

quit
easili
thi
left
a
black

aren
t
the
scene
on
the
cannib
island
irrelev
to
the
plot
mani
peopl
seem
to
think
thi
part
is
pointless
but
it
is
veri
much
necessari
after
bootstrap
tell
jack
that
the
kraken
is
after
him
jack
need
to
find
land
so
that
he
s
safe
from
the
beast
he
discov
howev
that
he
s
not
safe
on
land
either
not
just
becaus
of
savag

but
also
becaus
the
east
