young

made

veri

in

that
they
were
onli
vote

“

the

not

becaus
of
how
he
ran
against
her
…
t

sander

hillari
down
in

and
creatur
of

“
i

”
he
said
in

in

“
it
’
s
hard

to
take
on

to

in

”
what
make
sander
’
critic
of
clinton
especi
unfair
you
argu
is
that
it
’
s
simpli
not
true
the
two
politician
you
claim
are
equal
progress
and
polit
compar
when
sander
deni
that
progress
badg
of
honour
to

he
wasn

t
distinguish
hi
agenda
from

their
posit

pretti
similar
he
wa
exclud
her
from

compani
of

pure
…
and
yet
in
thi

piec
you
cite
and
agre
with
a
journalist
who
wrote
in
a
huffington
post
articl
that
sander
is
not
onli
more
progress
than
clinton
but
more
progress
than
all
democrat
as
jonathan
cohn
wrote
in
may
“
if
sander
is
the
standard
by
which
you
’
re
go
to
decid
whether
a
politician
is
a
progress
then
almost
nobodi
from
the
democrat
parti
would
qualifi
take
sander
out
of
the
equat
and
suddenli
clinton
look
an
aw
lot
like
a
mainstream
progress
”
you
and
cohn
agre
that
sander
is
uniqu
principl
and
progress
i
would
agre
but
that
undermin
your
entir
argument
which
is
base
on
how
similar
the
candid
were
if
sander
is
so
much
more
progress
than
clinton
the
enthusiasm
gap
between
him
and
clinton
isn
’
t
a
mysteri
it
doesn

t
requir
a
conspiraci
between

which
wa

they
look
at

not

they

they
chose
the
candid
who
call

like
they
saw
it
but
back
to
your
distort
of
hillari
clinton
’
s
record
these
young

weren
’
t
around
when
the
gop
…
began
a
seri
of
witch
hunt
that
have
never
end
they
didn

t
wit
the
complic
stori
of
how
the
1994
crime
bill
came
to
be
pass
or
the
origin
of
the
“
super
predat
”
label
not
coin
by
hillari
and
not
refer
to
black
youth
but
rather
to
power
older
drug
dealer
here
are
clinton
’
s
exact
word
“
they
are
not
just
gang
of
kid
anymor
they
are
often
the
kind
of
kid
that
are
call
‘
super

’
no

no

we
can
talk
about
whi
they
end
up
that
way
but
first
we
have
to
bring
them
to
heel
’.”
my
plan
here
wa
to
gentli
urg
you
to
rethink
your
interpret
of
clinton
’
s
word
by
point
to
scholar
and
the
new
jim
crow
author
michel
alexand
who
in
a
piec
for
the
nation
describ
clinton
’
s
languag
as
“
racial
code
rhetor
to
cast
black
children
as
anim
”
but
as
i
reread
alexand
’
s
piec
i
encount
onc
again
the
famou
super
predat
quot
in
it
context
it
turn
out
i
don
’
t
need
to
grace
unpack
your
argument
becaus
you
complet
misrepres
what
clinton
said
she
wa
undoubtedli
talk
about
kid
forgiv
the
exclam
point
i
’
m
write
with
such
urgenc
becaus
i
know
that
an
establish
scholar
writer
and
professor
such
as
yourself
would
be
mortifi
to
have
made
thi
mistak
and
would
want
to
know
as
soon
as
possibl
sarah
jone
anoth
millenni
feminist
also
caught
thi
error
so
you
will
want
to
fix
thi
befor
more
peopl
point
it
out
back
to
your
live
histori
as
i
watch
sander
enchant
the
crowd
it
wa
someth
of
a
deja
vu
experi
to
see
a
charismat
male
politician
on
stage
tell
women
which
issu
are
and
aren
’
t
progress
so
someth
about
the
dynam
between
hillari
clinton
and
berni
sander
reson
with
your
person
live
histori
with
men
on
the
left
and
becaus
of
that
those
who
see
sander
as
a
progress
politician
rather
than
as
a
stand
in
for
problemat
men
are
the
bad
feminist
who
mean
well
but
just
don
’
t
get
it
more
live
histori
in
mani
way
the
1960
decad
wa
more
male
centric
than
the
50
it
just
privileg
a
differ
sort
of
male
those
men
love
have
us
as
uninhibit
sexual
partner
and
helper
in
their
polit
protest
but
they
never
let
us
forget
who
wa
in
charg
of
creat
the
platform
or
who
belong
in
the
polit
spotlight
that
sound
unfair
i
’
m
also
not
sure
we
can
pin
that
on
sander
but
not
for
lack
of
effort
on

in

anoth
exampl
of

you
cite
which
undermin
your

thi
close

between

cool
over

the
clinton
were
both
friend
and
colleagu
of

who
would
serv
as
an

at
the

human

under

but
it
wa
the

of
1996
which
bill
clinton
sign
and
hillari
clinton
vocal
and

that
would
drive

caus
a

urg
bill
clinton
against
sign
the

wright
edelman
did
appear
on

when
the

given
how
much
clinton
refer
to
her
as
a

these
appear
were
few
and
far
between
and
wright
edelman
wa
certainli
not

you
