almost
poetic
justic
to

is

the
best

requir
the
structur
of
the
novel
to

cut
i
felt
that
it
wa
onli
right
for
me
to
approach
the
read
of
it
in
an
equal
disciplin
way
i
took
five
sheet
of
paper
and
divid
each
in
half
thu
end
up
with
ten
card
one
for
each
charact
and
i
continu
to
dillig
fill
them
out
with
all
the
detail
i
learnt
about
the
charact
until
about
halfway
through
the
book
when
i
becam
too
engross
frighten
and
nervou
i
alreadi
had
an
inkl
as
to
who
the
murder
wa
and
wa
petrifi
i
would
be
murder
in
my
sleep
as
well
the
situat
wa
veri
seriou
and
i
had
to
invit
all
my
teddi
bear
back
to
my
bed
so
they
could
protect
me
i
grew
to
like
two
of
the
charact
the
sentiment
i
think
i
share
with
christi
as
she
like
them
so
she
kill
them
last
thi
wa
my
second
christi

the
first

whi
and
not
the
how
that
certainli
i
didn
t
know
that
you
can
say
that
i
did
an
amateur
crimin
profil
and
that
help
me
to
have
a
suspect
of
my
own
that
it
result
true
also
i
had
some
advantag
for
be
spanish
speak
sinc
there
is
a
clue
that
onli
can
be
detect
due
that
not
matter
that
i
read
the
novel
on
english
but
take
in
account
the
veri
detail
that
it
s
inde
a
print
novel
i
catch
someth
and
put
togeth
some
clue
well
i
figur
it
out
believ
or
not
it
doesn
t
matter
anyway
i
think
that
mani
of
the
fun
of
read
thi
kind
of
mysteri
novel
is
tri
to
figur
out
the
culprit
dure
the
process
of
read
the
book
not
matter
if
you
guess
right
or
not
alway
it
s
reward
when
the
mysteri
is
explain
a
delici
way
to
make
your
neuron
to
exercis
again
know
who
wa
or
at
least
think
that
i
knew
who
wa
sinc
obvious
i
couldn
t
confirm
it
until
read
the
whole
book
it
didn
t
help
me
to
know
how
everyth
wa
made
until
it
wa
explain
on
the
novel
definit
agatha
christi
is
the
queen
of
mysteri
certainli
thi
novel
isn
t
onli
a
marvel
detect
mysteri
book
but
also
a
truli
scari
horror
stori
priceless
set
for
a
scenario
and
fantast
twist
charact
develop
appendix
juli
23rd
2014
the
clue
that
i
found
thank
that
i
am
a
born
spanish
languag
speaker
warn
warn
warn
warn
read
onli
if
you
alreadi
read
the
novel
sinc
thi
is
a
mega
spoiler
tell
who
the
culprit
is
i
seldom
put
spoiler
in
my
review
but
i
wrote
thi
appendix
basic
sinc
i
wa
contact
by
sever
reader
ask
me
about
the
big
clue
and
well
while
i
don
t
mind
to
share
it
well
also
i
don
t
want
to
find
out
later
that
it
wa
written
down
in
some
other
review
as
their
take
in
account
that
it
seem
that
onli
me
were
the
one
who
notic
that
view
spoiler
ok
the
big
fuzz
about
the
clue
that
i
found
is
that
the
first
charact
that
you
find
in
the
novel
is
mr
justic
wargrav
on
the
chapter
one
you
may
say
so
what
well
the
mysteri
coupl
who
invit
to
all
guest
the
initi
of
both
name
of
them
are
u
n
o
in
the
imaginari
woman
is
una
nanci
owen
and
the
suppos
husband
is
u
n
owen
u
n
o
that
in
spanish
can
be
spell
just
like
uno
which
mean
one
on
english
mayb
that
a
coincid
but
with
agatha
christi
noth
can
be
left
to
chanc
so
i
think
that
may
be
a
clue
target
to
the
reader
with
knowledg
about
spanish
languag

few

i

blown

by
what
i
perceiv
to
be
a
modern
twist
on
the
tradit
lock

mysteri
the
murder
scene
of
that
stori
wa
also
set
on
an
island
and
dure
the
commiss
of
the
crime
there
wa
no
way
on
or
off
the
island
not
onli
that
but
none
of
the
charact
wa
particularli
sympathet
and
pretti
much
ani
of
them
could
have
done
it
how
embarrass
wa
i
to
discov
that
agatha
christi
did
it
in
1939
in
and
then
there
were
none
and
better
sure
there
are
critic
who
on
at
least
one
occas
decri
her
work
as
contriv
overli
manner
unrealist
so
it
s
fun
it
s
well
written
it
s
clever
and
when
you
get
right
down
to
it
the
dirti
littl
truth
of
human
natur
as
reveal
by
dame
agatha
are
just
as
hard
hit
and
incis
as
those
reveal
by
ani
other
modern
mysteri
writter
and
might
even
be
a
bit
more
shock
when
hidden
deep
within
the
psych
of

we

from

off

led
me
up

to
bark
up

i
first
read
one
of
her
book
while
i
wa
around
13
or
14
like
in
a
lot
of
her
book
character
is
somewhat
perfunctori
while
the
plot
reign
suprem
in
the
context
of
her
book
thi
is
quit
understand
as
they
tend
to
be
quit
short
and
there
are
mani
plot
twist
and
turn
to
navig
with
thi
book
it
is
better
not
to
know
too
much
about
these
charact
it
make
the
reveal
at
the
end
of
all
the
more
effect
if
you
think
agatha

is
now
old

may
want

i

there

littl

frustrat
by
miss
marpl
s
lack

will
have
much

the
young
gover
the

the
cocki

the

they
all
have
a
dark
edg

the
ten
main
charact

some
of

other
were

someth
in

each
murder
occur
in
such
a
way
that
it
can
t
be
proven
in
a
legal
set
and
each
death
is
the
reason
these
ten
peopl
are
brought
to

island
by
a

realli
don

honestli
my
guess
the
entir
book
wa
miss
brent
she
wa
the
one
least
talk
about
she
wa
the
quietest
one
and
the
one

guilti
seem

i
think
i
figur
it
out
a
littl
bit
when
the
judg
die
the
set
up
of
hi
dead
wa
too
perfect
i
expect
the
climax
to
begin
right
there
but
he
wa
just
dead
so
when
i
figur
it
out
when
there
were
3
left
that
it
wa
someon
dead
who
wa
the
killer
he
wa
there
in
the
back
of
my
mind
so
i
didn
t
guess
it
but
honestli
it
s
the
one
that
make
sens
look
back
hi
death
is
realli
the
onli
one
that
i
m
like
