i
d
heard
that
sgt
pepper
s
lone
heart
club
band
wa
the
best
album
of
all
time
so
when
i
happen
upon
a
pictur
disc
display
behind
the
counter
at
birmingham
record
shop
–
a
snip
at
£
2
99
–
it
wa
a
no
brainer
thi
wa
1983
i
wa
13
my
pocket
money
wa
£
5
a
week
everi
penni
went
on
record
so
the
fact
that
i
still
had
£
2
01
chang
from
the
best
album
of
all
time
felt
like
an
absolut
triumph
plu
pictur
disc
it
would
take
year
for
me
to
realis
that
the
version
of
sgt
pepper
i
bought
that
day
is
almost
certainli
the
most
substandard
one
in
exist
show
a
pictur
disc
to
a
commit
audiophil
is
an
act
compar
to
show
a
shower
head
to
a
cat
or
a
pictur
of
le
denni
a
pictur
of
amanda
holden
even
wors
the
version
of
sgt
pepper
avail
to
record
buyer
in
the
earli
80
wa
the
stereo
one
famous
mix
in
less
than
an
hour
without
the
band
even
present
it
wa
the
mono
one
that
the
band
want
to
get
right
the
one
which
match
the
hardwar
that
most
peopl
would
use
to
listen
to
it
but
i
didn
t
know
ani
of
that
in
1983
becaus
sgt
pepper
wa
the
best
album
of
all
time
i
knew
i
need
to
listen
rever
so
i
wait
until
the
hous
wa
empti
and
then
in
the
lull
between
bruce
forsyth
s
play
your
card
right
and
juliet
bravo
i
took
the
record
out
of
it
bag
place
it
on
the
stereo
in
the
posh
room
that
no
one
ever
use
plug
in
my
headphon
and
realli
concentr
i
didn
t
give
myself
the
option
of
not
like
it
becaus
clever
peopl
than
me
had
alreadi
decid
that
it
wa
the
best
album
of
all
time
but
i
wa
expect
thi
record
to
transform
me
to
push
me
a
signific
distanc
in
the
direct
of
adulthood
i
expect
weighti
theme
dealt
with
in
allus
term
the
dionysian
pretens
of
the
door
were
more
comprehens
to
me
i
thought
that
wa
what
wisdom
sound
like
and
although
she
s
leav
home
and
get
better
were
pretti
i
struggl
to
squar
the
record
that
critic
describ
with
the
record
i
wa
listen
to
all
of
that
happen
later
in
tini
increment
drive
into
a
blizzard
on
the
west
coast
of
scotland
on
the
day
the
news
broke
about

the
manic

a
day
in

life
came
on
the
radio
that
wa
a
moment
by
the
time
i
wa
16
i
had
sort
of
realis
the
hole
that
paul
wa
fix
couldn
t
realli
be
mend
with
a
hammer
and
nail
i
had
quit
a
lot
of
those
sort
of
hole
too
be
for
the
benefit
of
mr
kite
scare
the
shit
out
of
me
then
and
is
still
apt
to
do
so
now
the
chemic
brother
live
deploy
of
sgt
pepper
s
lone
heart
club
band
repris
somehow
also
brought
me
to
a
deeper
understand
of
the
album
s
intent
sgt
pepper
wa
an
album
for
all
of
life
not
just
the
lyserg
all
nighter
but
the
bright
blue
morn
which
follow
them
not
just
for
the
13
year
old
for
whom
the
tune
are
enough
to
be
get
on
with
but
it
s
record
that
releas
it
secret
to
you
as
you
go
through
life
it
s
a
trick
that
paul
finess
on
penni
lane
a
song
which
paus
the
videotap
of
memori
on
a
scene
to
which
it
creator
can
never
return
and
as
a
result
get
sadder
with
everi
pass
year
of
cours
penni
lane
–
though
record
for
sgt
pepper
–
didn
t
make
it
onto
to
the
album
but
when
i
m
sixti
four
did
i
never
expect
that
one
to
leav
me
emot
blindsid
but
of
cours
that
s
the
geniu
of
young
paul
again
indic
precis
what
you
mean
to
say
your
sincer
wast
away
and
becaus
unlik
those
door
record
which
start
to
sound
a
bit
silli
by
the
time
i
reach
18
sgt
pepper
s
lone
heart
club
band
is
an
album
for
all
of
life
i
can
t
imagin
a
time
when
someon
hold
it
up
to
a
new
light
or
reveal
it
in
some
alter
form
that
i
won
t
find
absolut

all
of
which
help
explain
whi
i
m
one
of
a
hundr
odd
peopl
sit
in
studio

at
abbey
road
the
room
where
the
beatl
record
sgt
pepper
s
lone
heart
club
band
whose
50th
birthday
is
set
to
be
mark
by
what
must
sure
be
the
most
thorough
reissu
it
will
ever
receiv
from
may
26th
beatl
fan
will
have
to
ponder
whether
they
ll
shell
out
someth
in
the
region
of
£
110
for
the
six

super
delux
edit
or
content
themselv
for
the
two

doubl
lp
or
stand
alon
version
for
some
peopl
it
ll
be
one
reissu
too
mani
after
the
2009
mono
remast
and
the
2013
vinyl
remast
i
get
that
strip
away
all
the
extra
on
thi
one
though
and
the
main
event
is
the
5
1
stereo
surround
sound
version
that
gile
martin
and
sam
okel
have
been
work
on
as
martin
explain
thi
is
a
remix
as
oppos
to
a
remast
which
mean
that
he
work
from
the
individu
four
track
tape
in
order
to
build
a
stereo
version
that
could
final
supersed
the
one
that
wa
put
togeth
as
an
afterthought
back
in
1967
the
gimmicki
uncool
of
stereo
ha
been
a
constant
among
seriou
music
fan
for
pretti
much
as
long
as
i
can
rememb
but
when
you
re
on
a
budget
beggar
can
t
be
chooser
–
and
so
the
first
version
of
rubber
soul
ye
rubber
soul
i
ll
come
back
to
sgt
pepper
in
a
minut
i
ever
own
wa
a
stereo
one
thi
wa
the
full
dimension
stereo
of
the
american
press
with
it
inferior
track
list
i
return
home
from
a
trip
to
seattl
in
1993
place
my
3
purchas
on
the
turntabl
and
experienc
someth
of
a
minor
epiphani
thi
wa
an
experi
akin
to
listen
to
those
enoch
light
demonstr
album
of
light
orchestr
music
in
which
the
reveri
of
a
bucol
fugu
is
suddenli
broken
with
advanc
timpani
and
gallop
flute
but
with
some
of
the
best
song
you
ve
ever
heard
it
wa
effect
three
rubber
soul
in
one
the
left
version
of
girl
with
just
guitar
and
drum
foreground
just
what
a
sensat
sequenc
of
chord
chang
drive
it
along
the
right
version
of
the
same
song
featur
littl
more
than
harmoni
and
john
lennon
the
left
version
of
norwegian
wood
with
just
guitar
and
bass
hang
off
georg
s
sitar
the
right
version
of
the
same
song
with
guitar
and
tambourin
and
then
of
cours
the
straight
down
the
middl
version
which
put
you
at
the
centr
of
the
event
immers
in
beatl
i
love
the
damp
hair
rais
proxim
of
the
2009
mono
remast
but
did
i
love
them
more
than
the
supposedli
inferior
version
i
d
heard
16
year
previous
i
m
not
sure
but
stereo
can
be
unbeliev
excit
we
experi
that
excit
at
the
cinema
if
we
treat
it
with
respect
on
a
record
whi
shouldn
t
it
be
just
as
excit
the
answer
if
last
night
s
playback
is
anyth
to
go
by
is
that
it
is
–
and
it
s
a
differ
that
s
immedi
percept
on
the
eponym
open
song
the
terrain
is
suddenli
wider
which
mean
that
the
individu
compon
appear
to
occupi
more
room
without
crowd
each
other
out
i
ve
no
idea
technolog
how
that
happen
but
it
s
imposs
not
to
notic
it
georg
s
lead
guitar
sound
emphat
and
aggress
filthili
distort
at

ringo
like
the
fact
that

somehow
both

at

as

point
out
–
the

they
realli
dug
in
somewhat
self
deprecratingli
that
wa
someth
that
martin
said
he
d
fail
to
take
into
account
when
work
on
the
mix
with

realiz
it

start
tri

idea
for

fix
a

much
more
rock
than
the

version
with

tri
an

approach
to
the

so
mani
of

is
a
revel

peopl
thought
thi
wa
just
the

one
of
the
reason
it
wa
alway
the
pepper
track
with
the

feel
paul
marvel
at
the
