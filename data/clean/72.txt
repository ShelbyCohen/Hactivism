just

it

spontan
no

’

major
tactic
is
amass

thi
idea
is
widespread
becaus
the
big

are
like
the

of
an

the
onli
thing
visibl
from
a
distanc
did
it
look
like
the

start
with
a

and
follow
two

ralli

is
danger
your
peopl
will
get
arrest

it
’
s
riski
for
other
reason
a
spars
attend
march
is
a
disast
or
the
protest
can
go
perfectli
but
someon
—
perhap
hire
by
the
enemi
—
decid
to
throw
rock
at
the
polic
and
that
’
s
what
will
lead
the
even
news
one
fail
protest
can
destroy
a
movement
so
what
do
you
do
instead
you
can
start
with
tactic
of
dispers
such
as
coordin
pot
bang
or
traffic
slowdown
in

told
the

the



wa
the

mani
black
and
their

were
abl
to
surviv
the
sixti
bruce
well
our
strategi
wa
we
alway
did
carri
our
weapon
out
there
and
so
when
they
came
over
that
wednesday
night
and
start
to
shoot
and
when
they
got
down
there
about
half
a
mile
our
peopl
open
fire
on
them
and
so
they
turn
around
and
come
back
that
a
way
and
when
they
come
back
that
a
way
the
peopl
on
that
side
start
shoot
over
they
head
and
when
they
got
in
town
they
said
we
not
go
to
go
back
out
there
no
more
and
said

them
nigger
got
all
kind
of
machin
gun
out
there

and
that
word
got
out
and
so
from
then
on
we
never
had
no
more
problem
when
we
d
go
out
there
with
nobodi
come
by
shoot
no

so
that
broke
