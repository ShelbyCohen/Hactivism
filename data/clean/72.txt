the
onli
way

medit
otpor

“

”
nonviol
struggl
djinov
explain
is
a
war
—
just
one
fought
with
mean
other
than

it
must
be
as

spontan
no

a

is
no

myth
nonviol
struggl
’
s
major
tactic
is
amass
larg
concentr
of
peopl
thi
idea
is
widespread
becaus
the
big
protest
are
like
the
tip
of
an
iceberg
the
onli
thing
visibl
from
a
distanc
did
it
look
like
the
oust
of

start
with
a
spontan
mass
gather
in
tahrir
squar
actual
the
occup
of
tahrir
squar
wa
care
plan
and
follow
two
year
of

the
egyptian
opposit
wait
until
it
knew
it
had
the
number

t
the
begin
of
a

popov
write
they

re
a

peopl
in

is
danger
your
peopl
will
get
arrest

shot
it
’
s
riski
for
other
reason
a
spars
attend
march
is
a
disast
or
the
protest
can
go
perfectli
but
someon
—
perhap
hire
by
the
enemi
—
decid
to
throw
rock
at
the
polic
and
that
’
s
what
will
lead
the
even
news
one
fail
protest
can
destroy
a
movement
so
what
do
you
do
instead
you
can
start
with
tactic
of
dispers
such
as
coordin
pot
bang
or
traffic
slowdown
in

everyon
drive
at

these
tactic
show
that
you

well
our

wa
we
alway
did
carri

out
there
and
so
when
they
came
over

wednesday
night
and
start
to
shoot
and
when
they
got
down
there
about
half
a
mile
our
peopl
open
fire
on
them
and
so
they
turn
around
and
come
back
that
a
way
and
when
they
come
back
that
a
way
the
peopl
on

side
start
shoot
over
they

and
when
they
got
in

they
said
we
not
go
to
go
back
out
there
no
more
and
said

them

and
that
word
got
out

so
from

on
we
never
