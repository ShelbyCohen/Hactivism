the

base

the

remain

in

while

about

implic
of
the
aca
i
have
my
own
these
lesson
learn
are
not
just
for
poster
i
have
put
them
into
practic
in
both
health
care
polici
and
other
area
of
public
polici
throughout
my
presid
the
first
lesson
is
that
ani
chang
is
difficult
but
it
is
especi
difficult
in
the
face
of
hyperpartisanship
republican
revers
cours
and
reject
their
own
idea
onc
they
appear
in
the
text
of
a
bill
that
i
support
for
exampl
they
support
a
fulli
fund
risk
corridor
program
and
a
public
plan
fallback
in
the
medicar
drug
benefit
in
2003
but
oppos
them
in
the
aca
they
support
the
individu
mandat
in
massachusett
in
2006
but
oppos
it
in
the
aca
they
support
the
employ
mandat
in
california
in
2007
but
oppos
it
in
the
aca
—
and
then
oppos
the
administr
’
s
decis
to
delay
it
moreov
through
inadequ
fund
opposit
to
routin
technic
correct
excess

and
relentless
litig
republican
undermin
aca
implement
effort
we
could
have
cover
more
ground
more
quickli
with
cooper
rather
than
obstruct
it
is
not
obviou
that
thi
strategi
ha
paid
polit
dividend
for
republican
but
it
ha
clearli
come
at
a
cost
for
the
countri
most
notabl
for
the
estim
4
million
american
left
uninsur
becaus
they
live
in
gop
led
state
that
have
yet
to
expand
medicaid
65
quiz
ref
idth
second
lesson
is
that
special
interest
pose
a
continu
obstacl
to
chang
we
work
success
with
some
health
care
organ
and
group
such
as
major
hospit
associ
to
redirect
excess
medicar
payment
to
feder
subsidi
for
the
uninsur
yet
other
like
the
pharmaceut
industri
oppos
ani
chang
to
drug
price
no
matter
how
justifi
and
modest
becaus
they
believ
it
threaten
their
profit
66
we
need
to
continu
to
tackl
special
interest
dollar
in
polit
but
we
also
need
to
reinforc
the
sens
of
mission
in
health
care
that
brought
us
an
afford
polio
vaccin
and
wide
avail
penicillin
the
third
lesson
is
the
import
of
pragmat
in
both
legisl
and
implement
simpler
approach
to
address
our
health
care
problem
exist
at
both
end
of
the
polit
spectrum
the
singl

model
vs
govern
voucher
for
all
yet
the
nation
typic
reach
it
greatest
height
when
we
find
common
ground
between
the
public
and
privat
good
and
adjust
along
the
way
that
wa
my
approach
with
the
aca
we
engag
with
congress
to
identifi
the
combin
of
proven
health
reform
idea
that
could
pass
and
have
continu
to
adapt
them
sinc
thi
includ
abandon
part
that
do
not
work
like
the
voluntari
long
term
care
program
includ
in
the
law
it
also
mean
shut
down
and
restart
a
process
when
it
fail
when
healthcar
gov
did
not
work
on
day
1
we
brought
in
reinforc
were
brutal
honest
in
assess
problem
and
work
relentlessli
to
get
it
oper
both
the
process
and
the
websit
were
success
and
we
creat
a
playbook
we
are
appli
to
technolog
project
across
the
govern
while
the
lesson
enumer
abov
may
seem
daunt
the
aca
experi
nevertheless
make
me
optimist
about
thi
countri

capac
to

even
the
biggest

challeng
mani
moment
serv
as

that
a
broken

often
think
of
a

i
receiv
from

he
oppos
