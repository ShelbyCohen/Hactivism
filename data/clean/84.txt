felt
the
key
issu
with

with
institut
such
as
these
”

i
want
to
see

“
the
thing
that
keep
come
up
to
me
is
how
to
look
at
our
reproduct
right
and
separ
it
from
our
intern
oppress
”
pizii
said
pizii
clarifi
that
reproduct
justic
come
from
“
a
live
experi
of

”
argu
that
thi
fight
is
center
in
women

experi
“
when
we
slow
down
as
a
commun
and
start
look
at
that
what
doe

for
all
of
the
alli
and
how
is
the
framework
of
your

thi
is
where
the
work

the
