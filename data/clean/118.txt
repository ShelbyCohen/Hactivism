so
if

i
don
’
t
give
a
shit
what
richard
adam
say
about
hi
book
becaus
it
simpli
isn
’

accord
to
him
in
the
prefac
of
my
edit
thi
is
just
a
stori
about
rabbit
it
intend
purpos
wa
to
entertain
hi
children
in
the
car
that
’
s
fair
enough
but
he
also
say
there
is
no
intent
allegor
mean
whatsoev
i
find
thi
hard
to
believ
the
allegori
in
here
are
rich
and
meaning
they
don
’
t
just
allud
to
simpl
problem
they
’
re
complex
and
purpos
so
if
he
didn
’
t
intend
them
then
hi
unconsci
certainli
did
i
can
’
t
believ
the
literari
merit
of
thi
work
is
entir
accident
“
anim
don
t
behav
like
men
he
said
if
they
have
to
fight
they
fight
and
if
they
have
to
kill
they
kill
but
they
don
t
sit
down
and
set
their
wit
to
work
to
devis
way
of
spoil
other
creatur
live
and
hurt
them
they
have
digniti
and
anim
”
thi
ha
a
surpris
amount
of
depth
the
stori
is
a
comment
on
the
brutal
natur
of
man
and
hi
careless
attitud
toward
natur
it
is
a
suggest
that
he
kill
for
the
sake
of
kill
rather
than
out
of
a
need
for
surviv
it
is
a
statement
that
man
is
not
in
touch
with
natur
like
other
anim
but
in
spite
of
thi
he
is
redeem
and
capabl
of
the
opposit
as
much
as
the
appar
inde
thi
can
be
seen
with
the
littl
girl
who
save
hazel
the
rabbit
’
s
chief
at
the
end
of
the
novel
so
it
’
s
a
bit
more
than
a
basic
children
’
s
fabl
thi
is
one
of
those
rare
rare
book
that
can
be
read
by
anyon
regardless
of
age
and
tast
in
novel
it
realli
is
a
wonder
stori
that
ha
the
potenti
to
be
enjoy
by
all
inde
there
is
a
reason
whi
veri
few
peopl
have
not
heard
of
watership
down
and
it
’
s
not
becaus
thi
is
just
a
tale
of
rabbit
attempt
to
find
a
new
home
and
surviv
that
is
the
crux
of
the
plot
but
not
the
limit
of
the
scope
of
the
novel
it
ha
the
appear
of
a
children
’
s
novel
in
that
it
is
an
excit
adventur
about
rabbit
but
for
an
adult
it
ha
greater
depth
moreov
the
novel
question
the
artifici
life
that
captiv
anim
must
endur
and
demonstr
that
they
should
be
at
one
with
their
true
natur
like
the
rabbit
of
thi
novel
thi
for
me
is
a
rather
deep
observ
human
are
a
speci
that
superimpos
their
way
on
all
other
form
of
life
if
the
anim
don
’
t
adapt
then
they
die
i
’
m
not
go
to
go
into
the
murki
realm
of
moral
but
whatev
you
think
about
the
treatment
of
anim
thi
is
a
truism
human
destroy
natur
as
they
destroy
most
thing
i
’
m
sound
like
a
littl
bit
of
a
misanthrop
but
again
it
’
s
true
“
men
will
never
rest
till
they
ve
spoil
the
earth
and
destroy
the
anim
”
regardless
of
what
richard
adam
think
hi
book
is
an
allegori
for
mani
thing
he
may
not
have
intend
thi
but
the
finish
product
clearli
transcend
hi
motiv
it
ha
becom
a
real
work
of
literatur
one
need
onli
look
at
half
the
work
in
the
literari
cannon
to
see
that
the
interpret
of
these

rare
correspond

mani

even
say
the

and
is
just

if
thi
is
true
then
one
needn

further
than
the
wonder
tale
of

in

of
the
best
way
i
can
imagin
a
friend
record
the
entir
book
on
tape
and
for
a
coupl
month
i
play
the
tape
of
her
read
a
chapter
or
two
just
befor
i
fell
asleep
each
night
my
slow
exposur
to
the
book
under
ideal
circumst
may
have
influenc
my
percept
but
i
can
say
on
each
subsequ
reread
of
the
book
i
ve
come
to
appreci
it
more
you
can
read
the
book
just
for
the
stori
appar
the
author
wrote
the
book
from
stori
he
would
tell
hi
children
and
it
still
can
easili
serv
that
purpos
but
the
rich
of
hi
charact
lead
to
mani
interest
analog
to
human
life
for
instanc
from
hazel
you
can
learn
profound
thing
about
leadership
throughout
the
book
you
feel
that
hazel
is
the
natur
born
leader
of
hi
group
of
rabbit
but
richard
adam
wa
veri
care
to
develop
thi
impress
through
charact
featur
rather
than
power
relat
the
contrast
is
clearli
intent
sinc
the
other
leader
of
the
book
achiev
leadership
statu
through
veri
differ
mean
mani
peopl
think
the
book
take
a
strong
stanc
against
a
particular
kind
of
authoritarian
rule
but
it
is
import
to
recogn
the
book
give
thi
impress
not
through
structur
diatrib
or
through
argument
but
rather
it
evolv
out
of
charact
consider
and
out
of
the
stori
itself
thi
mean
that
the
result
is
far
more
complex
than
a
simpl
argument
for
instanc
although
gener
woundwort
may
be
seen
as
the
main
enemi
that
hazel
ha
to
deal
with
and
the
authoritarian
rabbit
is
portray
rather
neg
at
time
adam
quit
intent
add
some
detail
that
make
him
admir
to
the
other
rabbit
even
to
the
veri
end
a
diatrib
would
not
be
so
complex
fiver
is
anoth
great
charact
he
add
an
element
of
magic
to
the
stori
and
it
allow
adam
to
link
the
rabbit
he
describ
to
a
mythic
world
that
enter
into
the
stori
quit
frequent
one
can
almost
see
fiver
as
a
manifest
of
imagin
in
thi
world
big
wig
is
anoth
likabl
charact
and
the
stori
of
thi
rabbit
experi
in
efrafa
is
one
of
the
highlight
of
the
stori
besid
the
charact
the
descript
of
england
are
also
quit
acut
you
can
actual
track
the

sinc
adam
wa
care
to
describ
real
place
and
thing
that
attent
to
detail
is
often
miss
in
review
of
thi
book
final
the
thing
that
bring
all
these
featur
togeth
and
make
the
book
more
than
a
mere
stori
or
an
account
of
human
charact
or
a
diatrib
against
fascism
is
the
fact
that
adam
is
quit
consciou
of
the
fact
that
he
is
tell
the
stori
from
the
perspect
of

face
are

the

i
wa
read

not
rabbit
with

that
to
me
is
a
major
achiev
and
at
the

in

earli
page
made
me
feel
like
i
wa
read
a
book
at
a
read
level
below
my
comfort
zone
rabbit
are
rel
simpl
anim
and
adam
adher
to

principl
for
most
of
the
book
clever
wa
a
rever
trait
among
warren
coloni
and
is
reflect
in
their
stori
of
past
accomplish
by
legendari
rabbit
these
stori
pass
down

from
gener

provid
a
collect
sourc
of
cun

that
are
appli

situat
beyond
the

experi

our
erstwhil

it
doesn
t
take
long
for
the
all
male
coloni
to
realiz
that
if
they
want
kitten
they
must
have
doe
they
were
in
such
a
hurri
to
escap
the
warren
that
they
forgot
to
bring
the
mystic
other
half
necessari
for
reproduct
they
came
to
the
same
conclus
that
tribal
unit
have
come
to
for
thousand
of
year
if
they
don
t
have
someth
they

they
need
to

the

happen
to
have
a
plethora
of
doe
and
hazel
and
hi
band
of
intrepid
bunni
believ
they
are
clever
enough
with
the
help
of
some
unusu
alli
to
coax
away
enough
doe
to
insur
the
surviv
of
their
fledgl
societi
thi
set
up
one
of
the
most
puls
pound
showdown
i
ve
read
in
a
long
time
display
the
courag
of
the
defend
of
the
alamo
and
the
steadfast
of
the
spartan
at
the
battl
of
thermopyla
i
found
myself
glow
with
the
pride
of
a
particip
white
knuckl
and
all
as
the
watership
down
rabbit
defend
their
home
the
thing
about
thi
book
is
that
you
have
to
hang
in
there
i
have
start
and
stop
thi
book
a
hand
of
time
but
sever
review
on
goodread
convinc
me
i
wa
give
up
on
the
book
too
soon
at
about
page
70
i
could
feel
my
eye
look
over
with
long
at
the
stack
of
book
wait
in
the
wing
as
the
page
stack
up
i
start
to
care
about
thi
band
of
brother
i
wish
that
i
had
read
it
in
time
to
have
share
it
with
my
kid
there
is
much
to
be
discuss
especi
in
regard
to
how
societi
are
structur
about
courag
about
friendship
about
think
outsid
the
box
and
about
the
import
of
how
we
conduct
ourselv
within
our
own
warren
township
if
you
have
kid
young
enough
read
it
to
them
it
will
heighten
the
experi
for
you
and
them
i
ve
alreadi
got
thi
log
as
a
book
to
read
to

so
these

these

are
like
the
johni

of
bunni
pictur
the
rabbit
of
caerbannog
from
monti
python
that
would
probabl
be
closer
to
the
mark
than
thumper
from
bambi
joke
and
random
pictur
asid
i
thought
thi
wa
excel
i
wa
not
expect
to
like
it
and
that
is
whi
i
am
so
shock
that
i
did
there
wa
a
lot
more
depth
to
thi
book
than
i
ever
expect
“
mani
human
be
say
that
they
enjoy
the
winter
but
what
they
realli
enjoy
is
feel
proof

”
the

love
everi

one
of

bigwig
wa
my
favorit

don

t
know
how
anyon
could
read
thi

not
fall
in

with

to

how
is
thi
a

i
am
still
tri
to

i

how
it
seem
simplic
is
actual
made
of

of

surviv
is
the
big
theme
natur
but
anoth
one
is
the
coexist
between
the
old
way
and
the
new
way
the
balanc
between
the
natur
and
the
unnatur
innat
and
learn
it
s
not
just
the
rabbit
societi
that
is
plagu
by
these
choic
of
cours
on
a
superfici
read
it
would
appear
that
adam
favor
the
former
our

look
for
a
way
to
lead
the
normal
natur
rabbit
life
that
sharpli
contrast
with
the
decad
cowslip
s
warren
and
militarist
efrafa
but
on
the
other
hand
it
s
precis
the
open
to
the
new
thing
and
experi
that
allow
hazel
s
bunch
to
surviv
the
raft
and
the
boat
the
dig

the
interspeci

they
still

and
when

just
think
of
how

they
are

aren

like

and
it
s
both
their
similar
and
differ
from
what
we

make
the
stori
unforgett

they
fight

they

each

doe
a
neat
trick
in
deal
with
hi
rabbit
charact
they
are
not
quit
human
and
the
way
they
tri
to
puzzl
out
the

around
them
in
a
veri

make
them
more

peopl
in

suit
though
at
the

they
are
human
like
and
vari
enough
to
engag
the

they
have
their
own
languag
with
word
and
concept
deriv
from
their
understand
of
the

and
perhap
most
engagingli
they
tell
stori
and
myth
base
on
their
belov

these
stori
pepper
throughout
the
book
as

are
some
of
the
most
enjoy
part
of
the

and
add
a
depth
and

to
the

while
at

and
characteris
are

in
thi

even
at
almost
500
page
there
is
never
a
dull

those
look

realli
check

thi

that

with

’
s
eye
of
the
tiger
play
in
the
background
again
credit
ladyfiszion
the
characteris
side
it
is
worth
note
that
the
rabbit
in
thi
book
are
not
anthropomorph
anim
they
do
not
wear
cloth
drive
car
watch
tv
etc
yet
there
is
also
much
human
in
their
rabbitri
they
can
be
compassion
love
kind
cruel
egotist
melancholi
etc
these
human
trait
are
believ
portray
as
rabbit
trait
through
the
incred
talent
of
richard
adam
the
prose
is
absolut
beauti
with
wonder
metaphor
like
“
an
indestruct
flood
of
rabbitri
”
i
can
pick
a
great
passag
out
of
almost
everi
page
here
is
one
awe
inspir
exampl
mani
human
be
say
that
they
enjoy
the
winter
but
what
they
realli
enjoy
is
feel
proof
against
it
for
them
there
is
no
winter
food
problem
they
have
fire
and
warm
cloth
the
winter
cannot
hurt
them
and
therefor
increas
their
sens
of
clever
and
secur
for
bird
and
anim
as
for
poor
men
winter
is
anoth
matter
to
further
distinguish
rabbit
from
other
speci
a
littl

employ
throughout
the
book
most
of
the
word
can
be
understood
from

are
use
if
you
want
some
extra
help
with
these
you
can
check
out
thi
lapine_glossari
you
can
even
gloss
over
them
without
miss
a
beat
of
the
book
read
thi
book
is
a
littl
like
take
a
magic
potion
and
transform
into
a
wee
rabbit
i
am
not
normal
all
that
interest
in
cute

but
after
read
thi
book
i
realli
develop
a
huge
respect
for
these
littl

the
odd

realli
stack
against
them
yet
they
manag

the
languag
that
the

is
a
small
joy
to
see
among
mani
thing
which
i
found
lovabl
and
admir
in
the
rabbit
protagonist
of

is
their
love
of

the

of

and
hi
adventur
are
sprinkl
throughout
the
main
narr
and
serv
as
inspir
and
entertain
for
the
rabbit
and
as
a
way
to
find
courag
in
hard
time
a
review
in
the
new
statesman
prais
richard
adam
for
write
a
big
tens
picaresqu
stori
these
three
adject
probabl
best
describ
watership
down
peopl
have
seen
in
it
a
riff
on
the
oddysey
an
allegori
for
human
struggl
against
totalitarian
oppress
fascism
the
cold
war
but
at
it
heart
it
is
a
wonder
stori
about
a
group
of
rabbit
search
for
a
new
home
and
their
effort
at
establish
a
warren
they
provid
for
interest
protagonist
and
as
they
journey
goe
on
so
do
their
respect
role
develop
these
are
to
a
degre
archetyp
but
richard
adam
is
care
to
make
sure
that
each
rabbit
retain
it
individu
characterist
and
grow
as
the
stori
progress
relat
between
the
charact
are
not
black
and
white
as
in
mani
book
for
children
even
though
the
villain
figur
is
portray
with
obviou
neg
adam
make
an
effort
to
show
whi
it
would
be
influenti
and
admir
by
mani
other
rabbit
all
the
way
to
the
veri
end
occasion
adam
will
do
some
authori
intrus
and
explain
the
rabbit
habit
of
hi
protagonist
but
he
did
write
thi
book
base
on
the
stori
he
told
their
kid
and
they
probabl
ask
mani
question
concern
these
matter
as
most
kid
would
it
s
not
a
big
problem
at
all
and
can
actual
be
seen
a
nice
remind
about
the

back
in

wa

well
by
the
time
i
m
at

part

view
spoiler
and
the
rabbit
have
escap
the
field
of
blood
and
settl
on
watership
down
hide
spoiler
i
didn
t
realli
think
so
it
seem
like
it
had
been
too
easi
and
anticlimact
there
were
no
femal
charact
i
also
felt
that
the
theme
of
human
impact
be
neg
and
destruct
wa
a
littl
too
easi
novelist
now
as
then
have
their
environment
impact
as
do
we
all
it
s
easi
to
suggest
that
human
are
degrad
their
environ
harder
to
say
what
should
be
done
about
it
given
that
we
are
all
complicit
in
it
and
adam
make
no
effort
at
all
in
that
direct
littl
did
i
suspect
that
thi
wa
just
the
pre
ambl
to
a
tremend
adventur
in
which
thi
theme
would
be
drop
almost
entir
and
the
focu
would
shift
toward
question
of
leadership
govern
and
the
will
to
power
or
that
the
lack
of
femal
rabbit
would
turn
out
to
be
crucial
to
what
wa
go
to
happen
next
now
a
bunch
of
talk
rabbit
should
realli
be
laughabl
but
they
realli
aren
t
how
doe
adam
acheiv
thi
partli
by
creat
convinc
charact
someth
that
is
of
cours
crucial
to
the
success
of
ani
novel
but
that
doesn
t
resolv
the
absurd
of
talk
rabbit
one
method
adopt
by
adam
is
to
rememb
that
they
are
rabbit
not
just
metamorphos
human
which
one
might

would

these

like
rabbit

where
human

of

rabbit
behaviour
is

rabbit
behaviour
is
also
describ
in

from
a
posit

knowledg
but
here
s
what
make
the
whole
thing
realli
work
the

have
a
languag
folk
tale
myth
legend
and
religion
all
their
own
the
floati
black
rabbit
from
the
film
symbolis
death
and
in
the
book
is
a
good
deal
less
floati
more
corpor
and
even
more
scari
thi
doesn
t
stop
the
vagu

rabbit
of

take
him

thi

histori
that
merg
into

languag
that
is
convincingli
repres
religi
or
spiritu
element
to
it
cultur
seem
to
me
to
be
a
common
factor
link
the
best
work
of
fantasi
and
what
is
more
fantast
than
a
bunch
of
talk
bunni
peopl
talk
about
world
build
in
relat
to
fantasi
and
sf
i
would
suggest
that
these
aspect
of
the
world
to
be
built
are
crucial
the
rabbit
languag
is
so
well
handl

necessari
for

and
in

just

onc
stuck

the

their

is
a
challeng
adventur
of
the
highest
order
worthi
of
placement
on

with
the
best
in
literatur
that
tap
into
such
ancient
tradit
of
myth
and
legend
along
the
way
they
discov
other
rabbit
societi
that
have
made
unfortun
adapt
to
the
danger
in

the
univers
lesson
about
the
corrupt

and
about
compromis
which
trade
freedom
and
justic
for

are
portray
well
enough
to
satisfi
reader
of
all
age
without
disclos
plot
i
can
share
a
few
thing
i
love
in
thi
tale
adam
infus
enough
verac
about
rabbit
natur
and
percept
to
move
me
beyond
disbelief
that
they
might
talk
and
ponder
human
issu
and
concern
that
rabbit
can
fight
predat
or
among
themselv
through
kick
and
bite
is
true
so
it
’
s
not
much
of
a
stretch
to
put
violenc
of
a
human
order
into
the
stori
convers
element
in
the
stori
reveal
how
certain
rabbit
approach
to
life
hold
true
for
certain
human
to
surviv
they
must
be
wari
and
use
sneaki
method
to
go
undetect
i
like
how
adam
ha
the

have
a
tradit
of
tell
stori
of
rabbit
mytholog
which
glorifi
ideal
of
trickeri

much
like
nativ
american
stori
of

is
the

what

what

just

i
watch

just
to
see
if
it
would
be
worth
it
to
read
the
book
and
i
had
the

reaction
it
just
wasn

i

not

that

perhap

depict
as

more
intellig

one
probabl
are
they

a
system
of
social
organ
a
rich
folklor
some
of
their
includ
folktal
are
minor
masterpiec
in
themselv
and
at
least
to
me
laugh
aloud
funni
in
some
place
and
even
a
monotheist
religion
with
frith
the
sun
imagin
as
the
creator
deiti
it
would
be
safe
to
say
that
they
re
anthropomorph
to
a
veri
high
degre
also
protagonist
hazel
s
brother
fiver
ha
a
gift
of
second
sight
and
taken
liter
the
end
is
certainli
flavor
with
the
supernatur
it
s
also
so
power
beauti
and
poignant
that
barb
had
tear
in
her
eye
when
i
read
it
to
her
but
no
spoiler
here
that
said
howev
those
supernatur
element
are
simpli
flavor
for
a
stori
that
s
essenti
mostli
a
naturalist
tale
of
epic
on
a
rabbit
size
scale
earthli
adventur
a
classic
quest
narr
with
a
band
of
rabbit
flee
their
home
warren
brutal
destroy
by
human
to
find
they
hope
a
new
home
and
a
better
life
in
ani
respect
that
a
human
observ
could
physic
check
by
observ
natur
histori
physic
behavior
and
capabl

these
are
realist
rabbit
obvious
their
cultur
like
that
of

instanc
jean
auel
s
stone
age
peopl
in
the
earth
s
children
seri
is
the
author
s
own
imagin
invent
but
unless
we
could
do
a
vulcan
mind
link
a
la
star
trek
we
don
t
realli
have
ani
way
of
know
what
rabbit
thought
life
is
realli
like
or
how
intellig
they
actual
are
we
judg
by
brain
size
but
given
the
size
of
our
brain
eleph
and
whale
might
surmis
that
we
re
not
a
particularli
intellig
speci
so
no
one
can
categor
say
that
adam
specul
are
over
the
top
imposs
adam
knowledg
of
and
love
for
the
natur
world
of
southern
england
s
down
countri
and
the
anim
who
popul
it
is
palpabl
here
on
practic
everi
page
a
veri
clear
messag
in
the
novel
is
that
human
as
a
part
of
thi
world
are
too
often
not
anyth
resembl
good
neighbor
ruthlessli
selfish
rapaci
cruel
and
mindlessli
destruct
some
might
argu
that
the
anthropomorph
treatment
of
the
rabbit
here
undercut
the
messag
it
make
them
appeal
more
to
us
but
if
you
don
t
believ
they
realli
have
such
trait
you
might
say
that
thi
is
sentiment
fiction
and
real
life
dumb
rabbit
don
t
deserv
ani
consider
but
i
would
maintain
that
the
right
of
ani
creatur
with
a
capac
for
pain
to
human
treatment
and
to
respons
human
stewardship
of
our
common
home
doesn
t
depend
at
all
on
how
intellig
it
is
and
the
veri
fact
that
the
rabbit
here
are
so
human
like
in
their
thought
and
feel
give
adam
the
scope
to
use
their
stori
to
impart
some
veri
real
and
i
believ
spot
on
messag
about
human
societi
as
well
given
the
anim
protagonist
here
and
the
product
of
an

some
might
assum
thi
is
a

that
s
not
the
case
though
it
doesn

have

content
that

couldn

at

none
that
i
recal
the

to
one
anoth
in
time
of
need
what
is
it
that
they
need
comfort
of
cours
when
they
feel
scare
nervou
tire
or
homesick
they
perk
their
ear
up
and
sit
quietli
by
as
one
of
their

to
hi

hazel
and
tell
him
“
someth

”
there
are
rule
and
a
system
of
hierarchi
that
prevent
them
from

just
that
they
must
take
appropri
action
in

that

s
a

for
a
reason
and
the
reason
is
that
the
stori
is
compel
and
well
written
and
so
real
that
you
can
smell
the
grass
on
watership
down
and
feel
the
heat
of
the
summer
sun
one
of
my
favorit
thing
about
the
novel
wa
adam

use
of
epigraph
at
the
begin
of
each
chapter
it
wa
fun
to
figur
out
whi
the

had
chosen
each
epigraph
as
they
alway
relat
somehow
