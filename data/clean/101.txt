not
the

it

12

by
boba_fett1138
groningen
the
netherland
–
see
all
my
review
the
concept
of
the
movi
is
both
great
and
origin
but
howev
the
execut
of
it
is
not
exactli
done
in
the
best
way
possibl
the
movi
start
of
veri
slow
and
even
perhap
a
bit
bore
thankfuli
the
second
halv
of
the
movi
is
much
better
onc
the
action
and
stori
realli
start
and
take
more
pace
and
form
it
might
not
be
as
entertain
and
good
as
other
ww
ii
action
movi
meant
as
entertain
such
as
where
eagl
dare
kelli
s
hero
and
the
gun
of
navaron
but
it
doe
have
some
great
moment
in
it
which
still
help
to
make
the
eagl
ha
land
a
bit
of
a
must
see
for
the
fan
of
the
genr
the
stori
is
just
great
and
it
interest
to
see
a
movi
for
onc
from
the
perspect
of
the
german
side
for
onc
the
german
are
not
portray
as
ruthless
villain
but
as
soldier
with
valor
and
courag
instead
the
movi
is
perhap
a
bit
moralist
in
the
first
halv
of
the
movi
basicli
everi
german
soldier
shown
in
the
movi
openli
hate
hitler
and
is
against
the
deport
of
jew
to
the
concentr
camp
it
feel
too
forc
all
but
nevertheless
the
perspect
the
movi
is
told
from
is
great
and
work
good
for
the
movi
it
s
too
bad
that
the
movi
is
told
needlessli
slow
at
time
while
it
could
had
been
a
great
fast
pace
action
movi
the
movi
ha
a
great
cast
but
thi
is
not
realli
an
actor
movi
mean
that
the
movi
wouldn
t
had
been
ani
better
or
wors
with
some
other
lesser
known
name
in
it
it
wa
weird
to
hear
donald
sutherland
talk
in
an
irish
accent
and
robert
duval
with
a
german
one
also
treat
william
in
one
of
hi
first
movi
role
wa
horribl
as
the
american
soldier
capt
clark
on
the
other
hand
it
wa
great
to
see
donald
pleasanc
as
heinrich
himmler
other
big
name
in
thi
movi
are
michael
cain
anthoni
quayl
and
jean
marsh
the
action
sequenc
are
good
and
definit
the
best
part
of
the
movi
the
movi
is
somewhat
entertain
to
watch
and
it
doe
have
some
well
place
humor
at
time
but
it
not
quit
enough
to
truli
uplift
thi
movi
to
a
level
of
great
thi
last
movi
from
director
john
sturg
is
a
memor
but
not
perfect
one
