they
mark
a
major

forward
for
the
program

resist
how
globalis
resist
would
hijack
revolt
the
anti

movement
is
at
a
key
point
in
it
develop
three
year
ago
it
hardli
exist
the
next
three
year
will
be
crucial
thi
is
whi
we
ve
decid
to
make
public
our
fear
that
all
thi
good
work
could
be
undon
by
peopl
who
have
noth
to
do
with
thi

but
instead
want
to
take
it
over

thi
pamphlet
is
an
attempt
to
show
whi
the

are
tri
to

mindless
hoodlum
obsess
with

they
are
will
to
make
these
attack
so
they
can

therefor
the

after

n
the
middl
of
the
anti

converg
march
in
washington
dc
last
month
i
found
myself
nose
to
nose
with
a
line
of
polic
attempt
to
push
the
crowd
back
i
wa
face
an
angri
but
veri
short
policewoman
so
in
my
case
it
wa
actual
nightstick
to
bosom
get
back
get
back
she
wa
shout
but
our
line
wa
not
give
ground
i
explain
to
her
calmli
and
i
thought
quit
reason
that
we
were
not
go
to
get
back
becaus
there
wa
nowher
for
us
to
go
after
the
fall
–
our
futur
is
now
by

when
i
laid
down
my
weari
head
to
rest
on
monday
septemb
10
2001
i
felt
that
i
had
a
fairli
clear
idea
of
where
the
anarchist
project
wa
head
in
the
next
few
year
and
of
what
my
part
in
that
project
wa
to
be
