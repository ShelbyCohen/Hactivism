”
he
said
that
the

to
blame
for

teenag
rather
than
the
peopl
who
condemn
and
attack
them
some
homosexu
may
recogn
intuit
that
their
same
sex
attract
are
abnorm
—
yet
they
have
been
told
by
the
homosexu
movement
and
their
alli
in
the
media
and
the
educ
establish
that
they
are
‘
born
gay
’
and
can
never
chang
thi
—
and
not
societi
’

disapprov
—
may
creat
a

that
can
lead
to

like
perkin

then
these

along

line
of
the
follow
“
i

veri
pro
gay

i
have
gay
friend
but
i
do
not
believ
that
sex

the
actual
act

an

social

we
all

biggest
problem
is
that
