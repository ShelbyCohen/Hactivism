it
is
the

of

patrick

“

”
he
get
pretti

when

patrick

nobodi
’
s
say
there
wasn
’
t
a
blockad
in
world
war

it
’
s
just
that
the
joke
wa
self
evid
about
confus
histor
event
to
someon
who
took
even
the
smallest
second
to
ponder
it
the
point
is
just
so
you
’
re
still
a
fuck
idiot
for
not
think
thing
through
befor
you
commit
yourself
to
a
full
on
comment
on
the
internet
patrick
allen
ye
he
’
s
a
maverick
to
the
point
of
do
unreason
thing
even
though
he
’
s
more
contempl
brilliant
analysi
q
pedro
moro
i
realli
like
the
three
old
movi
becaus
of
the
stori
and
the
great
idea
but
what
captur
my
attent
in
the
star
war
saga
wa
exactli
what
isn
’
t
consid
so
good
the
action
although
it
doe
not
fit
well
in
the
univers
of
star
war
the
paper
of
the
action
in
the
new
trilog
is
to
attract
the
new
audienc
make
it
justifi
and
what
sabotag
the
new
movi
is
the
number
of
detail
that
were
tri
to
be
put
in
the
movi
becaus
of
the
lack
of
answer
in
the
old
trilog
they
put
a
lot
of
detail
becaus
they
need
not
onli
to
tell
a
new
stori
but
to
explain
an
alreadi
exist
one
thi
make
difficult
to
conceal
and
the
problem
are
seen
more
easili
as
a
17
year
old
nerd
i
would
put
the
film
in
thi
order
worst
–
i
iii
iv
ii
v
vi
best
i
would
put
thi
in
my
opinion
that
nobodi
need
to
share
if
you
don
’
t
will
to
becaus
of
the
action
involv
and
the
stori
and
in
the
problem
in
the
stori
appear
not
onli
in
the
new
trilog
who
would
put
a
week
point
in
a
massiv
weapon
like
the
death
star
whi
there
is
a
hole
that
take
it
to

it

outlin
with

depict
obiwan
and
anakin
go
through
adventur
and
you
’
d
have
a
pretti
decent
trilog
…
or
well
you
might
the
problem
is
not
the
basic
plot
idea
that
luca
use
the
problem
is
how
he
flesh
it
out
he
took
the
simpl
central
narr
of
the
first
three
episod
which
could
have
been
brilliant
in
the
hand
of
somebodi
who
care
about
thing
like
logic
and
coher
and
buri
it
under
sever
layer
of
shit
neglect
and
bad
act
he
made
no
appar
effort
to
screen
it
for
intern
contradict
appar
never
ask
himself
if
the
charact
were
believ
and
didn
’
t
bother
to
go
out
of
hi
way
to
bring
a
great
perform
out
of
the
actor
and
he
did
thi
becaus
he
is
at
hart
an
effect
man
he
love
graphic
he
want
to
build
a
wonder
and
complex
world
and
to
use
comput
graphic
to
creat
a
visual
cinemat
experi
that
wa
like
noth
seen
befor
and
he
did
that
and
brilliantli
but
in
hi
rush
to
do
that
he
thought
he
could
get
away
with
neglect
the
other
half
of
the
movi
–
the
stori
that
tie
it
all
togeth
and
that
’

where
he
fell
apart
and
whi
i
hate
the
first
trilog
so
much
anakin
’
s
desper
battl

isn
’
t
the
problem
it
’
s
that
luca
make
him
act
so
insipid
and
stupid
that
the
audienc
feel
he
turn
to
the
dark
side
becaus
he
wa
a
whini
man
bitch
and
not
becaus
he
wa
a
desper
and
brilliant
jedi
who
wa
at

just
a
boy
tri
to
save
the

he
love

i
like
your
altern
it
’
s
a
bit
gener
and
i
don
’
t
mean
that
in
a
rude
way
and
predic
on
the
idea
that
anakin
wa
kind
of
rotten
to
begin
with
but
it
’
s
coher
and
i
think
that
you
’
re
absolut
right
that
it
would
have
made
a
good
framework
for
the
first
three
episod
if
it
wa
treat
properli
i
get
the
feel
that
luca
want
to
play
up
the
tragic
hero
angl
and
that
’
s
whi
he
went
the
direct
he
did
but
i
do
disagre
with
you
about
one
strong
point
i
don
’
t
think
that
the
problem
with
star
war
i
ii
and
iii
is
the
central
narr
at
it

luca

battl
it

tri
to

it
just

and
also
i
don

mind
the

as

as

but
they
should
have
play
a
smaller

that
be

the

cool
and
what
you

not
the

remad

and
the

as

person
i
think
that
peopl
give
the

too
much

and
that
they
had
too
high
of

also
my

fact
that
the
droid
get
cut
down
like
butter
is
onli
a
problem
if
you
look
at
tpm
as
a
stand
alon
movi
–
and
everyon
in
the
audienc
knew
they
were
see
onli
1
3rd
of
a
trilog
1
the
seem
superior
of
the
jedi
what
make
their
eventu
fall
so
dramat
is
the
destruct
of
their
statu
as
nearli
invinc
figur
thi
ha
to
happen
out
of
order
from
the
origin
trilog
in
order
to
make
narr
sens
the
jedi
start
with
power
and
lose
to
evil
rather
than
start
as
goodi
underdog
it
’
s
ok
that
their
primari
oppon
are
incompet
in
the
first
movi
sinc
you
’
ve
alreadi
accept
that
you
are
in
for
a
trilog
fault
thi
aspect
of
the
first
film
after
the
whole
trilog
wa
a
failur
is
unfair
2
the
superior
of
the
clone
versu
droid
ever
wonder
whi
the
empir
would
bother
train
and
use
live
human
or
at
least
humanoid
under
those
stormtroop
outfit
rather
than
mass
produc
a
bunch
of
robot
i
certainli
wonder
that
as
a
kid
thi
wa
actual
a
clever
way
to
answer
that
question
by
show
the
incompet
and
unreli
of
the
mass
produc
machin
and
eventu
necess
of
the
mass
produc
clone
soldier
3
queen
are
more
excit
than
rook
the
lack
of
tension
throughout
the
film
wa
the
result
of
mostli
absent
villain
and
a
long
drought
of
stori
spent
on
the
silli
pod
race
what
would
a
more
compet
droid
armi
accomplish
the
audienc
isn
’
t
there
to
watch
the
conflict
with
the
droid
–
they
are
there
for
the
conflict
with
the
sith
the
stori
of
luke
and
leia
’
s
birth
and
anakin
’
s
descent
into
the
dark
side
the
fact
that
veri
littl
of
the
stori
ha
ani
relev
to
these
conflict
is
more
damn
than
whether
the
droid
were
worthi
adversari
love
the
review
just
disagre
on
a
few
thing
🙂
robin
grave
i
alway
thought
the
droid
were
the
protagonist
in
all
honesti
i
feel
that
way
about
all
six
movi
chuck
groin
punch
the
uruk_hai
’
s
uncanni
fight
abil
can
at
least
be
explain
away
through
magic
becaus
tolkien
wa
never
stupid
enough
to
make
it
work
via
microb
richter
belmont
the
prequel
are
stylist
design
to
be
that
way
but
we
can
dimish
the
effect
of
it
not
pay
to
see
the
movi
johnny_dk
i
like
the
battel
droid
jw6
you
can
ration
it
howev
you
want
but
i
am
99
5
sure
that
luca
wa
not
think
anyth
you
said
here
so
those
point
of
critic
are
total
accur
no
there
’
s
a
conspiraci
theori
i
heard
that
the
whole
reason
georg
made
the
prequel
is
to
show
how
shitti
the
old
republ
wa
after
the
6
’
th
movi
there
wa
an
invas
by
a
speci
that
turn
planet
into
organ
ship
in
a
matter
of
day
if
palpatin
knew
thi
in
advanc
then
it
’
d
be
freak
geniu
to
overthrow
the
republ
to
protect
it
jesu
christ
look
how
retard
both
the
senat
and
the
jedi
are
in
deal
with
a
bunch
of
fuck
retard
droid
the
empir
ha
trillion
of
troop
and
ha
a
station
that
can
blow
up
motherfuck
planet
ya
know
one
that
could
’
ve
been
turn
into
genocid
spaceship
but
yeah
the
sith
are
the
bad
guy
the
rebellion
just
caus
the
genocid
of
a
dozen
or
so
speci
grandam
luca
ha
a
veri
poor
track
record
with
movi
plinkett
say
that
luca
get
too
much
credit
for
star
war
and
i
agre
i
wouldn
’
t
trust
luca
with
ani
movi
if
i
want
it
to
be
more
than
eye
candi
you
could
say
my
idea
for
the
stori
is
similar
to
hi
but
he
doesn
’
t
tell
the
stori
veri
well
at
all
so
it
’
s
hard
to
tell
if
it
’
s
actual
similar
or
not
it
’
s
as
if
he
ad
in
so
much
crap
becaus
he
want
it
to
be
epic
it
becam
convolut
and
bog
down
with
meaningless
scene
the
first
sequel
could
be
thrown
out
entir
and
it
wouldn
’
t
chang
the
stori
at
all
that
is
the
problem
he
told
a
stori
that
could
fill
one
movi
spread
it
over
three
and
fill
the
void
with
pointless
action
and
visual
but
when
he
fill
the
void
he
water
down
the
stori
so
that
it
is
hard
to
follow
and
understand
zero_miles_per_hour
i
think
there
might
have
been
an
earlier
draft
where
it
’
s
explain
that
the
trade
feder
is
an
allianc
of
the
most
wealthi
planet
and
the
sith
are
manipul
them
through
their
greed
to
destroy
the
republ
from
within
and
padm
is
a
threat
becaus
she
’
s
tri
to
make
a
counter
allianc
thi
would
explain
their
name
their
robot
armi
and
their
desir
to
kill
padm
pod
such
stupid
review
🙁
zero_miles_per_hour
it
seem
to
me
like
what
they
should
have
done
is
not
make
the
jedi
avoid
romanc
instead
they
should
avoid
polit
like
they
could
make
anakin
secretli
have
a
crush
on
senat
padm
who
is
organ
a
counter
allianc
against
the
trade
feder
and
get
kidnap
by
the
apprentic
sith
becaus
palpatin
is
back
the
trade
feder
to
destroy
the
republ
from
within
so
anakin
will
agre
to
help
the
republ
save
padm
use
the
alia
‘
darth
vader
’
so
the
jedi
won
’
t
know
but
he
’
s
not
power
enough
to
do
it
and
palpatin
is
drawn
by
hi
forc
and
hi
immens
rage
and
convinc
him
to
becom
hi
apprentic
with
the
promis
of
godlik
power
without
realiz
that
thi
will
result
in
the
death
of
hi
other
apprentic
and
thi
caus
anakin
to
becom
darth
vader
perman
and
also
marri
to
padm
and
worship
by
the
republ
as
their
savior
so
palpatin
decid
to
abandon
the
trade
feder
and
use
hi
new
apprentic
to
weasel
hi
way
into
the
republ
meanwhil
the
jedi
have
figur
out
the
darth
vader
thing
by
now
and
come
to
stop
it
but
anakin
person
slaughter
them
all
except
yoda
who
’
s
too
power
and
obi
wan
who
wa
the
onli
jedi
he
actual
knew
person
but
use
that
much
forc
in
one
battl
nearli
kill
him
so
the
republ
build
him
the
suit
and
the
two
remain
jedi
flee
and
turn
the
trade
feder
into
the
rebel
allianc
eventu
join
by
padm
who
flee
with
her
and
anakin
’
s
kid
when
palpatin
turn
the
republ
into
the
empir
kevin
nice
idea
where
did
anakin
’
s
kid
come
from
though
kevi
donald
yeah
that
is
fuck
up
i
think
she
’
s
suppos
to
be
like
seven
eight
or
nine
year
older
i
alway
thought
she
wa
a
bit
of
a

but
what
you

first
of
all
i
’
m
not
even
start
defend
the
script
of
phantom
menac
in
gener
it
is
a
great
movi
with
great
stori
i
’
ll
just
comment
your
reason
the
need
of
a
protagonist
the
audienc
need
a
protagonist
who
the
hell
told
you
that
you
are
bound
to
the
past
where
all
action
movi
follow
the
veri
same
linear
structur
repeat
over
and
over
again
due
to
lack
of
creativ
onli
1
person
and
hi
problem
fill
the
whole
pictur
the
most
stupid
thing
on
the
older
movi
wa
the
center
around
luke
nobodi
knew
shit
about
the
rest
of
the
galaxi
what
is
the
senat
where
is
it
empir
of
what
you
see
dagobah
hoth
tattoin
and
endor
and
none
of
them
ha
ani
trace
of
govern
the
onli
place
you
see
that
ha
the
slight
sign
of
administr
is
bespin
and
that
’
s
not
even
an
import
place
in
the
whole
galaxi
from
that
you
have
to
imagin
how
is
the
rest
of
the
galaxi
i
rememb
that
when
i
wa
a
kid
most
peopl
use
to
think
that
the
whole
empir
wa
just
an
empir
of
spaceship
that
domin
underdevelop
planet
and
that
’
s
all
and
the
worst
thing
is
that
accord
to
iv
v
and
vi
that
’
s
accept
even
more
the
whole
univers
is
at
war
but
all
you
see
is
the
adventur
of
luke
how
stupid
is
that
i
can
’
t
blame
luca
he
said
himself
that
he
regret
not
have
the
tech
or
money
to
make
the
stori
as
wide
as
it
should
be
at
the
time
center
on
luke
is
a
limit
not
someth
to
be
prais
the
i
ii
and
iii
right
place
the
charact
stori
below
or
at
least
in
the
same
level
as
the
rest
of
the
univers
what
should
’
ve
been
done
to
the
iv
v
and
vi
as
well
sorri
but
all
i
see
here
is
someon
complain
about
not
have
a
bore
1
person
stori
about
a
singl
individu
save
the
whole
univers
in
hi
everi
move
what
is
realli
ridicul
to
think
even
for
a
countri
what
to
say
for
a
whole
galaxi
i
’
m
realli
glad
that
luca
fix
that
and
that
now
i
can
see
that
the
whole
galaxi
is
not
made
of
1
person
descript
of
charact
i
’
ll
pretti
much
get
into
your
game
han
solo
he
’
s
a
rogu
he
got
a
strang
facial
express
and
keep
uninitent
smill
due
to
lack
of
interpret
from
h
ford
that
onli
do
seriou
role
all
of
hi
face
are
overli
express
like
he
is
do
mimic
with
too
wide
open
eye
like
japanes
theater
wich
is
great
but
total
incoher
for
a
movi
from
the
whole
cast
he
wa
the
onli
one
that
made
me
see
that
it
wa
an
actor
not
a
charact
alway
speak
as
if
there
wa
a
third
person
see
him
act
qui
gon
he
is
veri
calm
and
experienc
know
what
to
do
even
at
the
worst
time
possibl
and
is
veri
patient
everyth
is
under
hi
control
but
if
someth
isn
’
t
he
doesn
’
t
mind
break
some
rule
and
be
a
littl
rebel
if
he
think
it
’
s
need
for
a
greater
good
that
just
perfectli
fit
the
person
obi
wan
show
in
the
older
movi
the
onli
differ
is
that
the
old
obi
wan
is
not
a
rebel
in
ani
way
sinc
there
is
no
jedi
order
c3po
just
a
clown
noth
more
it
is
exactli
the
same
role
play
by
jar
jar
or
even
by
himself
on
the
i
ii
and
iii
amidala
veri
seriou
and
focus
person
she
can
endur
ani
hardship
with
the
same
fearless
determin
she
appear
to
have
no
feel
while
lead
her
planet
but
she
is
sweet
smart
and
corageu
when
she
is
not
in
the
rule
of
queen
os
senat
and
thi
is
great
actual
i
can
’
t
even
imagin
a
queen
be
ani
other
way
what
should
she
be
steric
and
stubborn
like
leia
her
imag
is
the
same
as
angela
merkel
’
s
or
queen
elizabeth
’
s
also
doe
everyon
in
your
world
must
have
a
non
regular
behaviour
somehow
mayb
you
don
’
t
know
seriou
peopl
but
they
do
exist
also
stop
ask
moron
what
they
think
about
the
saga
ask
someon
that
at
least
understood
the
movi
let
’
s
just
make
anoth
question
game
shall
we
describ
the
galaxi
in
the
2
trilog
without
describ
specif
ani
planet
i
ii
and
iii
a
bibl
of
content
iv
v
and
vi
…
noth
wait
…
hoth
stori
let
me
see
…
the
whole
galaxi
is
at
piec
and
you
want
a
pointless
action
scene
at
the
begin
of
phantom
menac
how
ridicul
is
that
you
want
action
at
the
begin
watch
reveng
of
the
sith
and
fill
your
eye
with
grandios
and
shame
for
ever
have
said
that
you
’
ve
seen
a
great
space
battl
befor
asnwer
me
thi
base
onli
in
the
iv
v
and
vi
how
doe
the
galaxi
work
what
doe
a
jedi
do
the
answer
is
silenc
becaus
there
is
noth
about
the
rest
of
the
univers
in
the
older
trilog
i
believ
you
thought
that
a
jedi
would
just
go
wherev
crime
is
and
destroy
everyon
like
a
super
hero
so
naiv
if
you
’
re
more
than
15yo
luca
spent
some
time
show
everyon
what
is
the
galaxi
and
what
a
jedi
do
and
all
you
can
do
is
complain
about
not
have
a
battl
go
watch
braddock
damn
it
the
i
ii
and
iii
are
so
full
of
iform
becaus
the
have
to
set
their
own
background
and
the
background
of
the
older
trilog
that
wa
so
incomplet
the
older
trilog
could
even
be
renam
to
“
the
space
adventur
of
luke
skywalk
”
and
it
would
fit
becaus
there
is
noth
els
to
the
movi
now
tri
to
do
that
to
the
new
trilog
…
you
can
’
t
and
you
know
whi
becaus
there
are
mani
import
fact
and
charact
happen
everywher
in
the
galaxi
cover
all
the
time
in
differ
take
the
movi
is
rich
the
real
star
war
can
onli
be
seen
in
the
i
ii
and
iii
becaus
the
old
movi
don
’
t
have
a
galaxi
onli
4
or
5
unexplor
planet
1
moon
and
some
teddi
bear
i
’
m
stop
here
becaus
if
i
go
on
i
’
ll
find
much
more
flaw
on
your
review
much
more
than
i
thought
but
at
least
i
’
ll
just
explain
your
point
of
view
back
in
the
70
’
s
80
’
s
scienc
fiction
wasn
’
t
so
explor
as
it
is
today
and
that
’
s
a
great
part
of
the
success
of
a
new
hope
the
whole
movi
wa
like
noth
you
’
ve
ever
seen
befor
the
feel
that
you
must
have
felt
when
you
saw
it
on
the
theater
must
have
been
incred
almost
imposs
to
describ
i
envi
you
for
i
’
ve
never
seen
those
movi
in
a
theather
sinc
i
wa
born
in
1980
unfortun
that
feel
cloud
your
judgement
becaus
you
expect
the
same
feel
in
the
new
saga
and
that
’
s
imposs
becaus
scienc
fiction
and
alien
are
just
a
veri
commom
subject
today
also
you
have
the
“
oldman
’
s
revolt
”
i
creat
the
name
but
it
is
a
veri
well
known
syndrom
where
old
peopl
desper
tri
to
enrich
their
youth
to
see
it
as
fasr
superior
to
today
’
s
youth
even
young
peopl
that
hate
nowaday
life
style
can
have
that
syndrom
that
make
you
love
everi
singl
piec
of
shit
from
the
past
even
flaw
and
mistak
becaus
of
that
feel
you
tend
to
say
that
everyth
that
wa
old
is
better
but
look
at
yourself
you
are
complain
about
the
new
movi
becaus
a
queen
doe
look
like
a
queen
and
a
jedi
master
doe
look
like
a
jedi
master
or
even
becaus
you
are

with

…
that
’
s
just
absurd
you
prais
the
incomplet
and
despis
what
is
well
describ
i
know
thi
is
not
luca

fault
he
alreadi
said
that
he
didn
’
t
have
the
money
or
tech
to
make
the
old
movi
as
wide
as
they
should
be
but
limiti
are
to
be
just
respect
not

so
i
tend
to
overlook
these
flaw
don

wrong

realli
confid
that
i
’

one
of

about

–
ridicul

now
you
have
to
learn
that
what

not
necessarili
good
some
thing
are
but
not
everyth
also
all
the

deerstop
the
whole
“

”
is
not

a
veri
good
idea
becaus
be
differ
is
permit
to
some
point
it
’
s
never
said
in
the
movi
but
as
i
vagu
rememb
from
the
book
qui
gon
jinn
wa
a
bit
of
rebel
himself
and
often
disagre
with

that
’
s
whi
he
wore
a
long
hair
which
supposedli
is
prohibit
by
the
jedi
code
or
someth
john
de
gaull
are
you
fuck
seriu
idiotbox
there
wasn
’
t
a
joke
…

at
anonym
the
cuban
missil
crisi
1962
wa

what
i
don
’
t
get
is
how
anakin
is
the
most
power
jedi
but
he
is
not
as
power
as
the
emperor
or
starkil
it
’
s
like

’
s
a
basic
sith
youngkob
if

i
hate
to
“
come
out
the
gate
here
”
be
full
of
vitriol
but
after
watch
the
funni
and
brilliant
review
for
tpm
and
then
afterward
read
some
of
the
comment
on
here
about
the
review
itself
i
have
to
say
that
so
mani
of
you
miss
the
point
of
someth
like
thi
obvious
redlettermedia
use
comed
theme
to
creat
a
premis
and
that
premis
run
through
all
of
their
materi
especi
hitb
and
gamest

0
in
these
review
mr
plinkett
is
execut
a
style
of
humor
call
“
satir
”
in
fact
one
might
even
call
it
“
sardon
”
or
“
cynic
”
or
“
dri
dark
humor
”
the
intent
of
thi
review
and
a
lot
of
other
plinkett
review
is
to
insist
upon
the
fact
that
someth
as
silli
as
a
star
war
prequel
is
complet
overtak
hi
mind
and
he
is
drive
himself
crazi
to
the
point
of
obsess
and
rumin
over
the
smallest
detail
of
the
movi
imo
there
’
s
a
meta
joke
hidden
in
the
charact
of
mr
plinkett
–
mr
plinkett
’
s
liter
murder
and
defens
standpoint
on
hi
own
opinion
is
iron
a
lot
like
a
stereotyp
internet
comment
’
s
might
be
with
that
in
mind
the
reason
whi
thi
review
end
up
be
brilliant
is
becaus
the
cynic
tone
of
the
review
“
unintent
”
point
out
a
great
deal
of
plot
hole
technic
error
and
bad
scriptwrit
that
is
present
in
the
movi
i
can
say
that
i
’
ve
alway
been
a
fan
of
star
war
especi
the
ot
so
i
’
m
bias
as
well
furthermor
it
’
s
impli
that
mike
s
mr
plinkett
is
a
fan
of
the
previou
movi
becaus
someon
who
hasn
’
t
seen
the
ot
or
who
didn
’
t
appreci
worship
it
wouldn
’
t
dedic
so
much
time
to
point
out
the
inadequaci
in
the
continu
of
such
a
belov
and
hallow
seri
of
film
if
you
ask
me
i
person
thought
tpm
wa
bore
to
me
the
onli
“
cool
”
and
interest
part
of
tpm
wa
the
lightsab
duel
between
qui
gon
obi
wan
and
darth
maul
and
that
’
s
onli
becaus
i
like
the
lightsab
fight
scene
in
empir
and
jedi
so
much
i
’
m
bias
yet
we
are
all
bias
with
us
be
the
imperfect
irrat
carbon
base
heliotrop
that
we
are
thi
bring
me
back
to
my
origin
point
–
these
review
are
made
for
fun
and
entertain
rlm
never
take
themselv
too
serious
and
that
’
s
probabl
whi
they
’
ve
garner
so
mani
fan
it
’
s
funni
becaus
it
’
s
absurd
–
that
is
the
entir
point
of
comedi
it
seem
almost
impalp
that
so
mani
peopl
choos
to
nitpick
a
cheeki
silli
interpret
of
a
terribl
movi
from
their
own
perspect
all
while
take
themselv
too
serious
thi
“
armchair
critic
”
bullshit
is
like
ask
for
a
“
gold
star
”
from
the
denizen
of
the
internet
so
what
’
s
next
a
review
of
the
review
of
tpm
or
a
review
of
the
review
of
the
review
of
tpm
gimm
a
fuck
break
i
have
a
feel
that
the
naysay
on
thi
site
and
on
the
internet
in
gener
are
just
simpl
contrari
asshol
with
noth
better
to
do
than
to
rip
on
someon
who
’
s
do
someth
funni
and
origin
redlettermedia
make
hilari
satric
low
budget
yet
well
conceiv
internet
video
for
peopl
and
ask
for
veri
littl
in
return
that
to
me
is
a
lost
art
the
art
of
subtleti
it
seem
a
lot
of
you
could
use
a
littl
bahareh
khosravi
the
pizza
roll
scene
is
genuin
creepi
joel

voic
of

that

that
special

to

judgment
the

is
an
effect
devic
that
tell
the
viewer
“
even
an
ignor
psychopath
can
see
what
’
s
wrong
with

”
it
also
help
the

behind
the
charact
to
go
over
the
top
and
or

with
hi

aim
at

arn
mae
well
if

he

he

dunag
the

suck
dunag
“
he

by
someon
who
eventu
becam
what
he

”
where
wa
thi
explain
in
the
movi
dunag
cypress

–
insan
in
the
membran
marvin
falz
“
i
will
not
condon
a
cours
of
action
that
will
lead
us
to

”
and
so
on
make
sens
to
me
amidala
’
s
either
a
a
typic
politician
who
say
one
thing
and
doe
someth
els
though
not
on
the
grand
scale
as
palpatin
or
b
she
realiz
that
she
can
’
t
avoid
war
to
save
the
planet
though
we
don
’
t
see
a
scene
in
which
she
chang
her
mind
after
a
long
struggl
of
her
conscienc
to
show
us
what
a
good
charact
she
ha
wilson
chamber
to
be
charit
to
luca
your
interest
in
the
wider
univers
sound
like
what
i
’
ve
alway
assum
about
the
guy
—
he
wa
fascin
by
the
big
pictur
in
hi
head
the
first
problem
is
either
you
make
a
fiction
almanac
or
you
make
a
work
of
drama
even
if
luca
’
write
were
compet
plot
are
all
about
human
interest
and
pace
—
if
you
set
out
to
tell
a
stori
the
audienc
is
go
to
expect
a
stori
not
a
recit
of
indic
the
second
problem
is
that
luca
’
understand
of
hi
world
is
and
wa
alway
nebul
—
the
prequel
feel
like
recycl
fan
fic
becaus
it
wa
creativ
peopl
around
him
who
brought
the
origin
star
war
movi
to
life
by
introduc
their
own
interpret
suggest
and
challeng
luca
wa
the
spark
sure
but
hi
one
man
show
prove
he
wa
noth
more
storyguy
i
have
read
some
of
suggest
for
a
differ
version
of
star
war
prequel
well
here
is
my
suggest
after
the
titl
crawl
an
organian
ship
burst
onto
the
screen
as
it
drop
out
of
hyper
space
immedi
you
can
tell
that
the
ship
is
in
distress
as
the
light
and
power
flicker
on
the
ship
and
it
is
trail
smoke
the
two
man
cockpit
show
to
pilot
one
is
franticli
pull
up
star
chart
while
the
other
hit
buttom
to
keep
the
ship
oper
and
ask
“
where
did
we
end
up
”
the
other
explain
“
we
’
re
about
25
parsec
from
our
distinit
we
’
re
not
go
to
make
it
are
we
”
the
other
explain
“
without
hyper
drive
we
’
re
not
go
anywher
find
us
a
place
to
put
down
quick
they
’
re
right
on
our
tail
”
then
the
one
look
at
the
star
map
point
to
a
planet
the
ship
cruis
toward
the
planet
suddeningli
anoth

immedi
you

one
is
franticli
pull
up

while
the
other
hit
buttom
to
keep
the

oper
and
ask
“
where
did
we
end
up
”
the
other
explain
“
we
’
re
about
25
parsec
from
our

we
’
re

perceiv
it

trough

where
the

in

in

trilog
your
power
level
didn
’
t
matter
so
much
as
the
motiv
for
your

that
’
s
whi
they
send
a

in

first
instead
of
send
the

knight
to
fuck
everyon
up

steal

’

i
think
the

should
be
direct
at
the

audienc
becaus
the
old
theme
from
the
origin

none
of

thing
about

they

it
can
be

i
agre
the

are
better
in
the
fact
that
they
explain
star

on
a
galact
level
as
oppos
to
focus
on
just
a
few
charact
everyth
make
more
sens
with
the
addit
of
the
prequel
trilog
and
it
add
replay
valu
to
the
old
trilog
becaus
you
now
have
an
understand
of

what
he
doe
i

like
both

for

reason
william
shakesman
i
think
you
’
ve
got
it
complet
backward
the
review
take
itself
extrem
serious
but
insert
comedi
constantli
to
make
it
seem
like
it
doesn
’
t
the
comedi
keep
you
engag
while
the
point
are
hammer
home
you
may
not
have
notic
–
but
your
brain
did
qui
gon
booz
even
if
true
qui
gon
die
befor
dooku
becam
evil
and
never
knew
even
then
the
other
jedi
didn
’
t
even
know
–
they
just
consid
him
a
“
polit
idealist
”
so
if
you
truli
think
that
wa
part
of
qui
gon
’
s
charact
then
you
’
ve
been
punk
qui
gon
booz
i
alway
assum
they
had
to
go
down
the
trench
becaus
there
were
too
mani
defens
turret
along
the
surfac
to
approach
from
that
direct
oddli
enough
there
were
even
turret
in

trench
nope
…
ewan
mcgregor
is
the
main
charact
as
obi
wan
kenobi
i
am
confus
as
to
what
your
charact
point
is
william

tl
dr
you
should
open
a
dictionari

look
up
the

of

”
william
crafton
facepalm
nopantsbabi
he
’
s
the
main
charact
on
paper
but
he
is
not
integr
to
anyth
that
actual
happen
you
could
replac
him
with
ani
jedi
if
it
wasn
’
t
for
the

origin
most
of
hi
scene
are
also
not
to
progress
the

to

for

so
it
could

the

smoke
would
move
out

direct

daniel
i
wa
just
watch
menac
again
and
wa
struck
by
obi
wan
’
s
illog
reaction
to
their
first
encount
with
darth
maul
just
befor
they
leav
tatooin
so
obi
wan
wa
in
the
ship
expect
the
return
of
hi
master
when
suddenli
the
secur
guy
walk
in
say
“
qui
gon
is
in
troubl
”
obi
wan
then
calmli
alreadi
a
huge
mistak
walk
toward
the
windshield
and
see
a
guy
who
ha
come
out
of
nowher
carri
a
light
saber
and
attack
qui
gon
later
we
learn
at
the
jedi
council
that
the
sith
have
been
extinct
for
a
thousand
year
thu
neither
obi
wan
nor
qui
gon
have
ever
seen
one
so
what
should
be
go
through
obi
wan
’
s
head
when
he
saw
the
light
saber
fight
“
who
the
fuck
is
that
guy
i
probabl
know
him
becaus
hi
is
obvious
a
jedi
knight
but
whi
in
the
hell
would
he
attack
qui
gon
what
wa
he
do
in
the
middl
of
the
desert
to
begin
with
i
must
get
out
there
immedi
and
find
out
who
is
thi
guy
”
but
instead
he
sit
at
a
chair
and
say
“
take
off
over
there
fli
low
”
thi
is
probabl
the
first
time
he
ha
ever
seen
a
light
saber
duel
for
real
and
he
is
not
even
slightli
impress
by
it
daniel
anoth
thing
about
their
fight
at
tatooin
whi
doe
the
probe
have
to
return
and
report
person
to
darth
maul
couldn
’
t
it
just
send
a
messag
isn
’
t
the
point
of
have
probe
to
know
thing
without
have
to
actual
be
there
to
see
them
whi
would
darth
maul
choos
a
bike
to
get
to
their
ship
when
he
releas
the
probe
it
seem
he
just
stand
there
wait
so
i
assum
he
is
close
to
hi
ship
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
get
on
hi
ship
and
blow
up
the
naboo
ship
befor
it
take
off
ruin
ani
chanc
of
escap
what
if
he
get
there
in
the
exact
moment
that
they
are
leav
he
would
just
stand
there
in
the
sand
look
stupid
just
like
he
did
i
know
noth
about
script
write
but
i
think
that
if
darth
maul
got
there
in
hi
ship
just
moment
befor
they
leav
tatooin
you
could
have
a
quick
chase
scene
befor
they
jump
to
hyperspac
and
it
would
keep
the
sith
unknown
to
the
jedi
until
the
fight
sequenc
at
naboo
thi
would
fit
well
with
the
council
’
s
choic
of
send
just
two
guy
back
to
naboo
and
would
add
tension
to

wa
much
more
of
an
impact
charact
when
he
wa
a
fugit
and
toss
asid
on
a
dumpi
planet
it
wa
a
much
better
way
to
show
how
hi
power
didn

t
depend
on
the
typic
trap
of
the
world
to
see
yoda
all
mix
up

sinc
that
’

the

…
well
you

gborr
at

point
i
actual
had
a
checklist
of
small
thing
that
should
have
been
chang
to
make
the
phantom
menac
work
stuff
like
explain
the
trade
feder
as
seen
abov
explain
that
the
naboo
queen
is
actual
onli
a
diplomat
figurehead
who
period
get
chose
from
the
nobl
famili
and
strip
from
the
titl
at
a
certain
age
becaus
of
stupid
tradit
make
it
so
that
the
trade
feder
doesn
’
t
want
to
kill
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
outright
but
onli
bear
down
on
them
when
they
tri
to
snoop
around
the
hangar
bay
and
notic
the
invas
forc
make
qui
gon
veri
knowledg
and
flexibl
and
make
obi
wan
veri
impuls
with
a
rigid
moral
fiber
keep
jar
jar
but
make
him
a
pain
man
in
exil
instead
of
the
silli
clown
the
funni
accent
can
stay
it
work
as
a
juxtaposit
explain
the
blockad
the
way
i
did
somewher
around
here
in
short
the
big
ship
are
onli
there
for
interdict
field
the
atmospher
is
patrol
by
fighter
droid
and
the
battleship
are
onli
retrofit
cargo
hauler
so
they
don
’
t
have
the
firepow
to
stop
a
fast
ship
with
good
shield
drop
the
bit
with
r2d2
especi
the
“
thank
the

”
bit
he
should
be
introduc
either
on
tatooin
they
buy
him
to
help
with
the
repair
of
the
ship
or
when
they
get
back
to
naboo
as
one
of
the
fighter
astromech
droid
anakin
bond
with
introduc
darth
maul
earlier
and
give
him
a
simpl
straightforward
backstori
of
hate
the
jedi
and
stalk
the
main
group
for
a
while
make
anakin
older
at
least
fourteen
also
make
him
less
wide
eye
innoc
and
more
jade
he
is
a
slave
for
god
’
s
sake
and
show
him
to
be
gener
nice
but
manipul
from
the
get
go
also
make
him
want
to
becom
a
jedi
so
that
he
could
get
away
from
tatooin
drop
the
“
anakin
made
c3po
”
stupid
in
fact
it
would
make
sens
if
c3po
wa
on
the
queen
’
s
ship
you
know
protocol
droid
and
he
is
taken
to
the
planet
in
case
they
need
translat
drop
the
subplot
about

make
obi

of

and
make

chastis
him
for

develop
keep
the

make

of

aka
they
are
not
allow
the
use
of
the

but
are
drawn
to
those
strong
in
the

also
don

make

respond
“

t
feel

make
it
so
that
padm
stay
on

and
she
onli
meet
anakin
when
he
show
up
to
check
the

and
see
what

make

without

just
have

and
bare
win
that

more
than

right
there
make

to

buy

or
onli
anakin
and
all

have
obi

encourag
him
that
the

council
would
certainli
see

the

voic
their

that

he
tell

i

just

if
it

i
would
have
start
the

at

itself
with
the

armi
march
down
on

mayb
show
a

while
the

march
down

there
could
even
be

and
wreck
litter
the

aftermath
of
the

etc
then
cut
to
the

armi
final
take
the

and
then
have
nute
gunray
possibl
accompani
by
darth
maul
captur
padm
and
then
when
they
get
to
her
have
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
rescu
her
in
the
nick
of
time
and
then
they
would
have
to
hide
out
possibl
in
the
swamp
with
the
gungan
thi
way
there
would
have
been
a
immedi
represent
of
the
power
of
the
droid
armi
darth
maul
could
have
prove
an
adversari
for
the
jedi
from
the
veri
begin
there
would
have
been
no
jar
jar
and
all
the
nonsens
in
the
first
ten
minut
of
the
movi
etc
etc
etc
but
then
again
that
would
requir
rewrit
the
entir
script
from
the
get
go
and
as
i
said
somewher
around
here
when
i
wrote
up
these
idea
my
main
goal
wa
to
tweak
the
alreadi
exist
content
in
a
way
to
show
how
easi
it
would
have
been
to
fix
thing
with
just
a
minim
amount
of
care
gborr
the
random
asshat
wa
suppos
to
be
me
a
random
guy
from
the

who
could
still
do
a
better
job
at
pluggin
up
said
plot
hole
from
hi

chair
while
luca
supposedli
had
hi
“

”
and
a

assist
and
still
fail
to

so
so
yeah
i
still
hold
that
0
1
score
😛
hi

lnldzn
wow
gborr
i
can
see
thi

play
in
my
mind
while
i
’
m
read
your

…
and
it
’
s
way
better
than
luca

i
wish
it

’
d
pay
to
watch

lnldzn
oh
and
here
’

my

suggest
of
an
improv
chang
the

from
the
bumbl
idiot
they
are
into
someth
more
worthi
of
carri
out
the
main
villain
’
s
plan
or
if
you
realli
want
them
to
stay
the
way
they
are
make
it
absolut
clear
that
it
’
s
darth
maul
who
’
s
actual
call
the
shot
on
the
ground
and
that
the
viceroy
are
onli
tool
act
as
a
front
for
the
sith
–
mayb
even
have
maul
show
some
impati
at
their
incompet
becaus
as
thing
stand
in
the
movi
you
have
a
shadowi
figur

okay
i
may
not
have
been
clear
and
probabl
a
bit
drunk
too
for
which
i
apolog
my
main
point
wa
not
that
it
wa
unfunni
tho
i
still
think
the
scene
in
basement
wa
useless
but
that
the
voic
made
it
realli
difficult
to
watch
it
felt
uninterest
and
bore
regardless
of
what
it
wa
say
and
hope
thi
will
let
me
avoid
deal
with
peopl
like
you
i
specif
ad
the
ps
go
ahead
and
read
it
by
the
way
second
part
wa
much
better
mayb
becaus
i
got
use
to
the
voic
but
i
still
upheld
what
i
said
befor
i
absolut
hate
the
voic
and
found
it
hard
to
focu
on
the
word
that
is
my
opinion
and
if
you
have
a
problem
with
it
well
your
problem
but
i
do
apolog
for
the
way
i
have
express
it
it
wa
a
bit
over
the
top
i
wa
just
tire
of
listen
to
someon
who
didn
’
t
seem
like
he
even
care
about
what
wa
he
say
sound
tire
and
bore
himself
and
so
when
it
got
to
the
basement
scene
i
could
not
hold
it
anymor
again
i
wa
quit
drunk
and
went
too
far

r2
d2
scene
but
there
is
one
veri
short
part
of
the
movi
i
associ
with
a
feel
of
awe
and
that
is
in
the
open
scene
when
we
see
the
half
eaten
donut
in

of

alex
lee
after
have
to
studi
paradis
lost
i
have
to
comment
on
the
protagonist
part
it
is
consid
that
the
protagonist
in
that
poem
is
adam
but
he
doesn
’
t
show
up
until
book
4
out
of
12
book
up
until
then
it
wa
just
satan
tri
to
get
to
eden
and
god
’
s
ridicul
circuit
plan
to
give
jesu
a
chanc
to
sacrific
himself
and
all
the
event
that
happen
in
genesi
is
also
out
of
hi
control
so
i
would
say
that
the
protagonist
doesn
’
t
have
to
be
at
the
begin
of
the
stori
though
he
she
should
so
yeah
anakin
is
the
protagonist
in
thi
movi
eh
still
don
’
t
like
anakin
all
that
much
alex
lee
it
’
s
so
weird
too
consid
that
stormtroop
are
danger
even
though
they
keep
miss
and
don
’
t
shoot
that
mani
laser
either
but
the
droid
despit
be
rel
on
target
sinc
they
deflect
the
bolt
instead
of
dodg
them
are
still
no
threat
at
all
alex
lee
it
kinda
defeat
the
purpos
of
a
bodi
doubl
when
you
’
re
in

alex

holi
shit
you

alex

i
have
to
wonder
whi
not
one
ship
in

is
fire
from
the
sky
to
rain
death
on
the
gungan
armi
it
’
d
be
like
set
ant
on
fire
what
wa
the
point
of
deploy
an
armi
to
stop
the
gunga
if
they
could
do
that
it
’
s
not
like
all
the
ship
were
tri
to
defend
the
droid
control
ship
becaus
the
key
ship
is
left
alon
tapewormbik
i
also
alway
wonder
where
did
the
gungoon
get
all
their
war
equip
sinc
it
clearli
wa
design
for
on
ground
warfar
while
the
gungito
are
underwat
creatur
ye
it
look
shell
like
but
they
rode
biped
creatur
and
had
freak
catapult
so
either
the
gung
show
have
like
a
stash
of
stuff
on
the
mainland
or
they
had
to
drag
all
of
it
from
the
bottom
of
the
lake
where
they
keep
it
in
case
someon
attack
the
land
and
they
decid
to
defend
it
thu
blow
their
cover
themselv
tapewormbik
i
agre
and
it
probabl
at
some
stage
wa
total
intent
sinc
luca
wa
all
about
the
“

you
are
utterli
clueless
the

some
of
the
greatest

ever
made
manctofu
peopl
criticis
these
review
by
state
that
the
origin
movi
also
had
plot
hole
have
miss
the
point
the
point
is
that
plot
hole
can
be
forgotten
or
skim
over
if
the
charact
and
stori
are
engag
enough
when
charact
are

if
the

the
problem
with

come
into

after
that
it
get

harder
to

with

the

there
on

it
’

becom

that

peopl

okay
so
i
said
that
i
don

anymor
but
i
’
m
still
disgust
whenev
i
discov

tell

my

i

m
begin
to
believ
that
“
they
must
be
dead
by

destroy
what

”
becam
the
work
motto
for
the
product
of
attack
of

and
reveng
of
the
sith
lucki
for
us
that
the

onli

is
holi
and
immort
and
it
puriti
be
protect
by
it
fan
alex
lee
see
as
how
luca
call
the
gungan
“
goonga
”
mispronouc
that
word
doesn
’
t
seem
to
matter
realli
anni
stone
i
realli
love
all
the
prequel
so
much
more
than
the
old
star
war
movi
becaus
they
were
old
and
now
the
prequel
are
start
to
get
old
so
i
don
’
t
like
them
that
much
ani
more
admir
bone
to
pick
yeah
but
like
the
phantom
menac
paradis
lost
is
total
convolut
and
confus
and
doesn
’
t
make
a
lot
of
sens
if
the
phrase
“
plot
hole
”
had
exist
in
the
seventeenth
centuri
then
someon
like
plinkett
would
probabl
have

on

you

erin

i
like
these

i
think
they
not
onli
demonstr
that
the

charact
were
inferior
to
the
origin
trilog
but
that
the
prequel
were
inferior
on
a
technic
and
directori
level
as
well
i
think
they
help
peopl
who
may
have
had
difficulti
verbal
exactli
whi
they
didn

t
like
the

as
much
as

i
love
all
the
star
war
movi
prequel
includ
as
we
saw
the
origin
that
introduc
us
to
the
world
and
it
’
s
rule
with
refer
to
the
event
of
the
past
thi
meant
that
essenti
there
couldn
’
t
be
as
much
drama
as
we
knew
how
the
prequel
would
play
out
we
knew
the
emperor
would
take
over
and
form
the
empir
you
watch
the
prequel
to
se
just
how
that
unfold
as
for
who
is
the
main
charact
i
’
d
say
obi
wan
we
don
’
t
experi
it
through
hi
perspect
as
it
’
s
more
of
a
third
person
movi
but
obi
wan
ha
encount
with
everyon
els
and
even
emot
reaction
with
them
as
a
jedi
he
doesn
’
t
can
’
t
throw
out
tear
but
show
concern
out
hi
master
defi
the
council
ob
wan
is
a
by
the
book
jedi
but
also
loyalti
as
he
care
deepli
for
hi
master
seen
in
the
end
when
jinn
die
and
obi
wan
get
mad
and
aveng
him
in
what
may
be
the
best
dual
of
the
seri
he
is
worri
about
anakin
trust
the
council
’
s
view
that
he
is
danger
but
ultim
decid
to
train
him
becaus
it
wa
jinn
’
s
last
request
thi
show
an
arc
as
it
’
s
the
first
time
obi
wan
ha
been
will
to
defi
the
council
and
with
the
knowledg
of
the
origin
we
know
the
mistak
that
it
is
to
train
him
and
that
he
’
ll
be
the
death
of
the
jedi
so
we
are
see
the
begin
of
the
end
by
the
way
i
don
’
t
get
the
retard
voic
in
the
video
that
i
hope
is
an
act
for
the
video
and
the
mispronunci
of
protagonist
i
work
in
film
tv
as
an
editor
and
have
my
degre
in
screen
art
and
while
i
can
say
your
basic
formula
doe
suit
sic
fi
and
fantasi
best
as
we
need
a
relat
charact
to
guid
us
through
it
is
not
essenti
as
long
as
the
rule
of
the
world
are
clearli
establish
as
they
were
with
the
origin
open
titl
open
scene
then
we
have
a
context
to
put
these
charact
into
jack
brown
amen
to
that
star

which
ha
alway
show
great
stori
of
new

twice
now
been
blown
up

alex

i
’
m
go
to
treat
thi
comment
as
if
it
isn

t
troll
for
the
sake
of
argument
obi
wan
doesn
’
t
do
anyth
in
thi
movi
though
he
’
s
in
the
background
follow
order
and
that
mean
he
can
’
t
be
the
main
charact
in
thi
stori
becaus
he
isn

t
realli
interact
with

qui
gonn
doe
qui
gonn
’

the
one
that
make
the
plan
make
suggest
and
perform
most
of
the
action
especi
when
it
come
to
anakin
in
the
movi
obi
wan
doe
none
of
these
thing
and
he
bare
react
to
the
world
around
him
becaus
he
’
s
on
the
ship
or
drive
the
submarin
or
someth
there
’
s
also
the
fact
that
qui
gonn
get
the
most
screen
time
of
ani
charact
in
the
movi
now
i
get
the
feel
that
luca
wa
write
a
sanjuro
charact
for
those
who
never
saw
yojimbo
or
sanjuro
thi
charact
wa
a
beard
conniv
master
swordsman
who
wa
secret
about
hi
feel
and
help
the
weak
in
a
weird
and
roundabout
way
the
reason
whi
sanjuro
work
but
qui
gonn
doesn
’
t
is
that
the
use
of
the
term
“
knight
”
impli
nobil
honesti
and
forthrighted
thi
problem
is
further
compound
by
the
inher
dualiti
of
the
star
war
univers
where
good
and
evil
are
pretti
clearli
defin
in
contrast
yojimbo
and
sanjuro
are
a
littl
bit
fuzzier
on
the
subject
and
certainli
wasn
’
t
one
of
the
main
theme
of
those
movi

aspect

about

as

you
are
actual
argu
that
thi

wa
better
off
without

claim
that
there
is
some

you

peopl

the

just
like
there
couldn

what

the

just
how

they
were
about

the

it
’

onli
after

that
they
recogn
the

in

got
worri
to
the
point
of
want
to
evacut
they
didn

about

…
and
it
’

safe
to
assum
the

had
some

with
also
…
“
what
about
the

so
goddamn
stupid
”
–
as
oppos

the
complet
useless

equal
stupid

of

or
ani
oppos
armi
forc
in
ani
movi
ever
made
if
they
were

compet
the

would

there
would
be
no

“
howww
are
they
gonna
lose
the
battl

”
–
the
same
way
the
american
forc
lost
in
vietnam
hale
exhaust
vent
are
a
pretti
basic
part
of
engin
and
you
wouldn
’
t
want
to
cover
those
up
87544
when
you
diss
the
origin
trilog
you
diss
yourself
steve
the
fish
pretti
true
although
luca
believ
that
america
lost
to
the
ingenu
of
the
north
vietnames
and
reflect
that
with
the
ewok
the
real
problem
is
that
america
fought
the
war
on
the
enemi
’
s
term
instead
of
target
the
enemi
’
s
infrastructur
and
bomb
the
railway
munit
dump
etc
we
just
had
american
soldier
wander
around
the
forest
get
ambush
and
kill
much
like
the
stormtroop
while
luca
may
believ
that
victori
wa
due
to
the
viet
kong
’
s
ingenu
it
wa
actual
the
result
of
america
’
s
incred
stupid
lbj
and
macnamera
should
burn
in
hell
for
how
they
ineptli
drag
that
war
out
just
to
profit
off
the
soldier
elcamino
the
weird
thing
is
that
keira
knightley
wa
cast
as
one
of
queen
hotpantspadm
’
s
decoy
jonathan
martinez
luke
is
protect
by
the
forc
and
that
total
compens
the
fact
that
he
is
a
new
pilot
so
he
get
a
special
shield
right
i
dont
think
that
how
the
forc
work
plo
koon
got
taken
down
while
he
wa
fli
and
he
is
strong
with
the
forc
and
it
wa
a
damn
clone
who
took
him
down
the
damn
torpedo
look
like
slow
move
lazer
about
the
death
star
what
is
thi
the
twenti
first
centuri
such
structur
should
be
extrem
formid
and
not
have
direct
acc
to
the
core
sure
the
other
ship
are
like
mosquito
so
they
didnt
worri
but
if
you
built
such
a
huge
thing
protect
the
interior
is
the
first
thing
you
do
about
the
droid
some
droid
do
pose
a
threat
mayb
not
toward
jedi
but
toward
other
yea
and
a
lot
the
clone
trooper
in
the
origin
arent
a
threat
to
absolut
no
one
the
guy
that
made
thi
review
is
expect
realism
from
the
movi
what
if
we
expect
realism
from
the
origin
than
we
got
a
problem
so
fuck
the
guy
who
made
the
review
ultim
thi
is
a
matter
of
when
wa
star
war
a
part
of
your
childhood
for
me
the
prequel
were
a
part
of
my
childhood
jonathan
martinez
lol
exhaust
vent
for
that
particular
gener
is
the
death
star
power
by
combust
chamber
by
fuel
alberto
the
star
war
prequel
were
also
part
of
my
childhood
i
love
the
phantom
menac
when
i
wa
a
kid
and
look
forward
enorm
to
episod
ii
and
iii
see
the
film
open
the
door
to
the
rest
of
the
rest
of
the
trilog
and
other
film
in
gener
i
still
watch
the
six
movi
regularli
and
enjoy
do
so
but
at
the
same
time
i
find
the
origin
trilog
much
more
involv
and
compel
the
use
of
practic
effect
and
real
life
set
play
a
role
in
make
it
feel
more
real
and
immedi
but
the
overal
develop
of
the
stori
charact
and
dialogu
are
a
much
more
signific
factor
it
isn
’
t
so
much
that
they
are
complex
and
complet
plausibl
human
be
but
that
we
relat
to
their
motiv
escap
from
one
’
s
own
place
of
origin
and
overcom
an
overwhelm
tyrann
forc
is
a
recurr
theme
in
luca
’
s
work
visibl
in
the
two
non
star
war
featur
luca
direct
there
are
trace
of
it
in
the
prequel
in
the
charact
of
anakin
skywalk
but
luca
shot
himself
in
the
foot
by
deliber
invok
a
world
that
isn
’
t
as
black
and
white
in
it
moral
i
have
constantli
tri
to
relat
to
anakin
’
s
transform
and
find
it
compel
in
theori
much
less
so
in
execut
hi
film
’
s
relianc
on
cgi
creat
vast
and
pretti
landscap
but
don
’
t
have
the
same
dramat
effect
as
the
use
of
light
more
thi
effect
is
more
limit
it
ultim
boil
down
to
one
’
s
own
opinion
and
the
argument
they
defend
them
with
a
good
case
could
be
made
in
favor
of
the
prequel
as
well
as
a
case
against
the
origin
trilog
though
i
haven
’
t
found
a
wholli
convinc
one
yet
becom
irat
becaus
the
death
star
ha
a
vulner
point
or
becaus
luke
’
s
ship
is
never
taken
down
is
nitpick
and
aren
’
t
valid
reason
to
take
down
an
entir
film
they
are
well
known
narr
trope
from
the
genr
that
inspir
luca
to
write
the
film
in
the
first
place
of
cours
luke
isn
’
t
go
to
get
shot
down
he
’
s
the
main
charact
and
unless
the
death
star
is
power
by
some
sort
of
perpetu
motion
machin
which
is
imposs
in
practic
scientif
term
it
need
some
sort
of
fuel
to
oper
there
are
great
film
that
have
small
inconsist
if
not
outright
plot
hole
plinkett
doe
hi
fair
share
of
nitpick
and
point
out
inconsist
but
hi
overal
argument
is
the
same
that
the
film
doesn
’
t
evok
the
same
emot
connect
that
the
origin
film
did
if
you
realli
like
the
prequel
thi
may
not
chang
your
mind
and
i
don
’
t
want
to
but
keep
in
mind
that
the
point
of
thi
kind
of
analyt
exercis
and
ani
review
in
gener
is
not
to
chang
your
opinion
but
to
exhibit
the
author
’
s
opinion
and
hope
it
encourag
further
reason
discuss
on
a
certain
topic
so
don
’
t
attack
the
peopl
express
opinion
that
you
disagre
with
and
pleas
find
a
more
coher
and
courteou
way
of
express
yourself
have
a
nice
day
hale
…
yeah
like
most
machin
i
’
d
figur
it
would
need
some
type
of
fuel
and
a
way
to
let
out
the
exhaust
from
said
fuel
i
mean
onli
a
total
moron
would
have
troubl
grasp
such
a
simpl
concept
…
hale
they
were
part
of
my
childhood
too
but
at
least
i
grew
up
and
saw
them
for
what
they
were

hear
hear
alex

“
you
said
it
brother
wait
you

that
”
harri
s
plinkett
alex
lee
the
best
thing
about
the
phantom
menac
is
that
you
can
forget
everyth
that
happen
in
it
and
it
won
’
t
affect
the
prequel
in
the
slightest
ii
and
iii
are
unfortun
necessari
to
the
origin
trilog
jonathan
martinez
lol
so
the
death

is
power
by
fossil
fuel
no
way
jonathan
martinez
thank
you
for
your
repli
but
you
cant
deni
how
awkward
the
act
wa
in
the
origin
especi
leia
im
not
say
the
prequel
had
greater
act
but
they
were
more
seriou
make
me
believ
it
wa
real
scenario
about
cgi
or
practic
effect
cgi
is
much
better
im
just
use
to
modern
film
at
thi
point
anoth
point
that
i
hadn
’
t
brought
up
yet
is
the
light
saber
duel
oh
boy
did
i
cring
when
i
saw
them
in
the
origin
the
best
light
saber
duel
are
all
in
episod
3
and
portray
the
jedi
and
the
sith
is
imensli
import
for
me
jonathan

clash
even

the

a

the
point
be
that

in

the

even
for

–
luca
is
claim
that

make
peopl
more
awar
of
the
forc
ignor
for
the
moment
the
fact
that
all

are
not
just
pervad
by
the
forc
at
all

but
they
actual
creat
the

make
it
downright
silli
to
think
there
would
be
greater

lesser

of

so
ubiquit
the
main
contradict
in

is
that

he
doesn

mention
the

at

state
that
such
awar
of

is
the
onli
real
differ
in
a

’

abil
the
most
offens
thing
about

is
that
as

by

”
fuck
you
luca
cabbo
rememb
that
the
main
point
of
these

is
not
to
show
plot
hole
caus
by
over
fantast
scienc
fiction
the
charact
and
their
action
are
complet
broken
in

no

is
abl
to

without
do
someth
stupid
beg
for

if
we
do
the

with

we
’

be

satisfi
ye
you
can
nit
pick
over
the

some
of

element
of

trilog
the
problem
discuss
in

aren
’
t
just
littl
point
about
the
fantasi
they
show
the
crack
run
throughout
the
entireti
of

addit
even
if
the

trilog
wa
terribl
how
doe
that
justifi
the
aw
of
the
prequel
i
know
that
thi
review
speak
to
how
they
’
ve
ruin
the
star
war
franchis
but
if
you
take
that
out
then
all
the
neg
that
lead
to
that
conclus
still
stand
on
their
own
whi
defend
the
prequel
by
say
that
the

trilog
is
bad
rather
than
that
the

are
good
even
if
you
’

got

for

you
should
still
be
abl
to
realis
that
they

cabbo
if

are
your
opinion
then
you
’

either
tri
far
far
too
hard

you
have
no

they
were
made

so
aw
that

becam

thi
movi
probabl
would
’
ve
been
good
”
he
wa
just
so
over
the
top
bad
that
all
the
other
more
subtli
bad
thing
in
the
movi
seem
good
by
comparison
it
wasn
’
t
until
the
second
and
third

which
had

they

dark

mijk
hey
i
just
stumbl
over
thi
nice
convers
here
plu
point
for
us
rlm
fan
…
no
one
ha
threaten
jm
with
rape
or
anyth
there
might
still
be
some
good
in
us
also
no
one
quot
plinkett
show
him
‘
how
stupid
he
is
’
but
consid
hi
argument
which
is
a
good
think
so
i
’
ll
join
in
to
thi
‘
bottomless
comment
section
’
bash
the
origini
is
okay
and
i
even
think
your
point
are
valid
the
exhaust
pipe
thing
wa
a
bit
simplist
and
wa
use
to
wrap
up
thing
of
enorm
proport
pretti
quick
luke
didn
’
t
get
hit
…
he
just
doesn
’
t
…
what
a
lucki
guy
not
the
onli
one
in
movi
histori
certainli
a
lot
of
lucki
padm
anakain
obi
wan
in
the
prequel
as
well
but
nevermind
that
what
i
rather
can
support
is
to
defend
the
prequel
not
everi
point
plinkett
make
is
undebat
true
also
i
find
nitpick
is
a
nice
thing
which
one
can
appli
to
everi
movi
especi
your
favourit
one
it
doesn
’
t
ruin
the
movi
it
just
make
you
wonder
about
it
again
you
don
’
t
forget
them
and
that
is
a
good
thing
at
least
with
good
movi
all
in
all
plinkett
is
right
even
in
hi
first
statement
thi
movi
wa
sooo
dissapoint
i
wa
22
when
i
hit
the
theatr
in
1999
and
these
movi
weren
’
t
made
for
me
and
my
age
perhap
but
i
wa
will
to
forgiv
a
lot
i
still
do
so
defend
the
prequel
is
a
veri
hard
job
i
would
like
to
see
a
witti
person
make
a
counter
review
to
plinkett
here
and
for
the
record
say
someth
like
‘
well
you
don
’
t
like
my
favourit
movi
i
think
your
star
war
is
an
asshol
too
’
doesn
’
t
count
as
witti
so
what
is
there
to
like
i
also
don
’
t
think
all
cg
is
bad
naboo
look
incred
i
like
the
royal
starship
and
darth
maul
ship
as
an
inuendo
to
later
tie
fighter
i
like
the
hippi
like
jedi
qui
gon
jinn
he
becam
the
first
jedi
spirit
and
that
touch
upon
some
sort
of
lore
i
would
like
to
hear
more
about
subtleti
in
contemporari
movi
is
not
onli
lack
it
is
process
to
camp
4
so
i
wonder
how
veri
subtl
thi
whole
thing
play
out
in
the
prequel
the
jedi
order
wa
flaw
befor
their
extinct
but
even
though
they
sort
of
knew
about
thi
there
wasn
’
t
a
final
statement
like
yoda
say
oh
it
all
went
to
bit
becaus
we
haven
’
t
done
anyth
we
must
learn
more
about
the
forc
like
that
wick
new
spirit
thing
qui
gon
recent
got
into
’
whi
did
yoda
have
to
go
into
exil
after
break
up
the
fight
against
palpatin
if
he
did
so
for
becom
wiser
and
rethink
thi
whole
‘
jedi
and
the
forc
’
thing
couldn
’
t
they
at
least
say
so
but
i
want
to
point
out
good
thing
in
the
prequel
i
don
’
t
mind
jar
jar
he
wa
an
idiot
charact
for
sure
but
they
got
rid
of
him
mostli
even
in
episod
2
and
i
don
’
t
consid
ani
of
these
film
superior
to
episod
1
jake
lloyd
wa
a
kid
in
a
star
war
movi
he
wa
fli
and
shoot
and
say
some
thing
i
don
’
t
mind
him
either
i
even
prefer
him
to
hi
later
incarn
becaus
he
wasn
’
t
evil
all
the
time
ye
lloyd
anakin
wa
a
nice
help
boy
and
introduc
us
also
to
thi
young
padawan
thing
which
got
a
dark
pay
off
in
the
end
palpatin
plan
…
well
that
is
a
biiig
nitpick
right
there
it
is
hard
to
look
past
the
huuug
flaw
of
thi
plan
and
the
crazi
coincid
that
need
to
happen
to
make
him
the
emperor
in
the
end
but
even
that
i
am
abl
to
forgiv
it
is
like
luka
and
vader
in
the
death
star
trench
…
veri
lucki
i
don
’
t
mind
inclus
of
jabba
or
most
of
the
other
charact
sinc
it
wasn
’
t
more
than
a
nod
includ
c
3po
and
chewbacca
wa
pretti
stupid
…
but
at
least
r2
origin
wa
handl
nice
well
i
can
go
on
and
on
still
after
all
these
year
but
just
a
last
word
for
jonathan
martinez
here
i
also
don
’
t
hate
the
lightsab
duel
of
the
prequel
they
don
’
t
need
to
be
overload
with
emot
the
littl
emot
the
prequel
duel
convey
wa
enough
for
me
i
at
least
understood
their
motiv
but
sinc
you
were
go
soo
into
detail
about
everi
move
darth
maul
qui
gon

obi

jonathan

oh
we
were
just
have
a
small
convers
thank
you
for
your
insight
repli
i
saw
the
video
veri
interest
perhap
there
are
no
movi
to
depict
light
saber
duel
well
enough
even
in
the
origin
ben
kenobi
vs
vader
it
look
like
they
were
fenc
at
a
veri
slow
pace
i
pick
darth
maul
vs
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
as
an
exampl
for
emot
and
had
explain
the
reason
of
that
battl
outcom
the
video
you
sent
me
demontr
how
the
director
fail
in
some
fight
choreagraphi
nontheless
it
wa
excit
for
me
that
is
perhap
i
should
have
focus
on
the
duel
in
episod
3
anakin
vs
obi
wan
that
could
have
well
been
the
best
duel
in
the
entir
movi
seri
in
conclus
i
like
innov
and
new
idea
sinc
mani
believ
the
duel
were
so
good
in
the
origin
should
they
have
done
similar
duel
in
the
prequel
i
dont
think
so
movi
have
to
be
made
to
convinc
me
to
think
what
they
’
re
do
is
real
akeuw
the
fight
in
these
movi
are
just
ridicul
it
is
like
the
romantic
sword
fight
versu
a
real
one
in
the
real
one
they
go
side
to
side
tri
to
hit
past
the
shield
there
are
no
overhead
hit
becaus
that
would
expos
the
fighter
same
with
the
prequel
there
are
dozen
of
opportun
for
the
fighter
to
hit
say
the
leg
and
they
are
not
taken
d
man
two

of

of
the

is
that

up

then
he
retrofit
a

they

there
’

one
minor
note
about

chang

wonder
whi
we

so
irrit
robert

“
captain
panaka
”
some
charact
i
can
’
t
even
describ
insid
their
role
robert
eckert
it
doesn
’
t
appear
you
understood
what
hulk
wa
get
at
then
hulk
is
say
that
the
primari
purpos
of
the
plot
howev
much
logic
the
plot
ha
or
fail
to
have
is
to
understand
the
develop
of
the
charact
plinkett
is
point
out
that
the
plot
hole
here
are
of
that
particularli
ruinou
kind
which
make
the
charact
’
action
random
and
unmotiv
so
that
we
cannot
care
what
they
do
or
what
happen
to
them
alex
lee
he
’
s
a
captain
…
that
’
s
it
robert
eckert
there
wa
also
a
chang
of
govern
in
franc

ww2
barri
herber
that
sound
fair
enough
to
me
i
believ
it
sydneydud
aussi
plinkett
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
these
review
lol
these
prequel
are
the
result
of
luca
not
have
other
movi
and
stori
to
rip
off
thi
time
around
he
’
s
been
expos
as
the
fraud
he
is
who
rode
in
on
the
tailcoat
of
the
other
who
actual
pull
togeth
and
made
the
origin
trilog
while
he
wa
given
a
lollipop
and
told
to
sit
in
a
corner
with
hi
star
war
doll
starcrunch
dead
on
i
think
georg
luca
ha
thi
idea
of
someth
realli
cool
that
’
s
go
to
happen
and
then
write
hi
stori
to
fit
that
cool
thing
in
it
’
s
not
the
worst
idea
–
plenti
of
writer
do
the
same
thing
but
when
you
are
tri
to
incorpor
some
byzantin
intrigu
and
labyrinthin
plot
it
realli
doesn
’
t
work
starcrunch
i
’
m
not
confus
jake
lloyd
or
hayden
christensen
for
that
matter
with
a
good
actor
but
no
one
and
i
mean
no
one
save
thi
poorli
conceiv
anakin
the
reason
you
say
he
“
adequ
”
portray
happi
go
lucki
is
becaus
that
’
s
the
onli
thing
given
to
him
you
could
have
had
the
best
child
actor
out
there
and
it
would
have
been
the
same
the
problem
is
the
write
long
befor
the
cast
even
get
consid
mitchel
taco
nash
when
’
s
the
next
episod
i
plinkett
review
mitchel
taco
nash
they
need
to
reboot
thi
thing
alreadi
…
to
diminish
the
effect
of

david

it
break
my
heart
to
tell
you
thi
but
you
are
right
mr

i

i
don

i
think
it
´
s
stylist
design
to
be
that
way
i
e
kind
of

so
the

get
the

so
bore

in

like
the

the

oh
my

you
just

caleb

gafford
first
i
will
admit
that
the
stori
is
illog
in
episod
1
as
are
most
fantasi
sci
fi
plot
becaus
they
all
tend
to
ignor
common
sens
and
practic
solut
in
favor
of
theatric
and
2
and
3
seem
to
me
to
advanc
the
plot
that
were
left
hang
in
ep
1
except
the
midichlorian
issu
i
admit
that
be
said
there
were
discrep
of
logic
in
the
origin
trilog
as
well
as
far
as
what
they
should
’
ve
could
’
ve
or
would
’
ve
done
secondli
from
someon
who
ha
never
read
the
peripher
regard
the
prequel
trilog
i
found
qui
gon
to
be
a
passion
master
who
lead
with
hi
gut
the
opposit
of
most
jedi
and
queen
amidala
wa
young
but
intellig
and
wise
beyond
her
year
but
with
youth
come
the
obstacl
of
be
underestim
but
she
is
someon
who
would
put
her
duti
abov
all
els
at
least
in
the
begin
third
i
find
that
tell
a
stori
of
a
power
order
and
republ
be
uproot
by
villain
who
don
’
t
have
the
initi
advantag
the
opposit
of
the
origin
trilog
is
harder
to
do
thu
that
explain
whi
they
had
to
set
up
with
extra
charact
and
take
three
time
as
long
as
to
get
their
point
a
cross
fourth
i
enjoy
how
they
use
polit
to
move
the
stori
rather
than
a
person
journey
i
’
m
a
huge
game
of
throne
fan
and
lastli
the
issu
of
the

excus
me
for
you
to
make

i

you
haven

read
too
much
scienc

therefor
you
take
it
as
given
that
when
you
refer

we
understand
that
you

there
is
alway
the
possibl
of
a
small
inconsist
in

to
move
a
stori
along
we
are
talk
about
larg
inconsist
that
strain
the
limit
of
credibl
and
the
suspens
of

one
that
break
you
out
of
the

and
have
you
activ
question
the

as
the
stori
is
unfold
if
you

the

i

you

that
the

and
respect
for
the

the

compar
to
the

there
is
some
solid
content
in
the

but
there
is
also
evid
lazi
write
and
gener
contempt
for

a

of

would

bruce
wayn
what
is
it
with
rick
jager
so
while
i
agre
with
most
of
thi
i
gotta
say
the
point
of
a
deflector
shield
is
to
prevent
the
ship
from
get
hit
in
the
first
place
not
absorb
damag
like
a
health
bar
most
shot
would
just
bounc
off
which
is
whi
the
ship
doesn
’
t
get
it
after
it
fix
lucki
power
shot
could
still
break
through
which
caus
the
damag
in
the
first
place
not
that
thi
save
ani
part
of
thi
scene
though
yeesh
sinwar
who
came
up
with
the
retard
idea
to
let
the
dealer
whose
race
is
intellig
and
“
immun
to
jedi
influenc
”
tri
a
dice
base
gambl
bet
…
you
know
against
a
jedi
with
telekinet
abil
thoma
hunt
hi
point
wa
that
the
matrix
and
the
other
movi
he
mention
at
least
had
a
protagonist
thoma
hunt
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
what
plinkett
say
about
lightsab
duel
in
thi
review
and
all
hi
other
is
true
for
fight
scene
in
gener
fight
scene
are
just
that
scene
their
purpos
is
to
advanc
the
plot
and
develop
charact
in
the
origin
trilog
the
fight
scene
were
not
onli
justifi
but
necessari
creativ
choreographi
can
be
fun
on
it
own
they
live
but
the
ultim
point
of
a
fight
is
to
progress
the
stori
romeo
and
juliet
play
in
the
1600
’
s
probabl
didn
’
t
have
veri
convinc
swordplay
but
obvious
that
didn
’
t
keep
it
from
becom
one
of
the
most
well
known
stori
in
world
literatur
even
in
pro
wrestl
a
medium
where
a
larg
part
of
the
appeal
is
in
the
aesthet
of
the
simul
violenc
there
are
storylin
and
thing
at
stake
to
justifi
whi
match
occur
sometim
those
element
are
absent
but
even
then
a
good
wrestler
will
captiv
the
audienc
with
hi
charisma
becaus
of
thi
fan
will
becom
invest
in
these
wrestler
over
time
and
will
consist
root
for
them
regardless
of
the
circumst
surround
their
match
go
back
to
film
that
just
illustr
whi
it
’
s
import
for
the
audienc
to
actual
like
and
or
care
about
the
peopl
fight
chien_clean
but
matrix
had
a
horribl
protagonist
the
movi
wa
great
despit
neo
keanu
so
it
wa
bad
exampl
the
other
movi
i
agre
with
thoma
hunt
just
to
add
in
regard
to
the
final
duel
in
empir
there
are
a
few
thing
plinkett
didn
’
t
quit
touch
on
luke
’
s
first
fight
with
vader
is
a
david
vs
goliath
battl
much
like
the
x
wing
take
on
the
death
star
in
the
first
movi
thi
time
it
’
s
differ
though
becaus
luke
fail
and
end
up
get
hi
hand
chop
off
even
though
he
lose
though
there
are
still
moment
in
the
fight
where
he
surpris
vader
with
hi
skill
and
persever
like
when
he
narrowli
escap
be
frozen
by
forc
jump
out
of
the
carbonit
chamber
it
’
s
moment
like
those
that
realli
reson
with
an
audienc
underdog
are
awesom
and
when
the
odd
are
realli
stack
against
them
everi
hit
they
land
can
seem
signific
just
think
of
rocki
manag
to
floor
apollo
creed
in
the
first
round
even
though
that
wa
brief
and
onli
serv
to

off
it
got
the
audienc
’
s
blood
pump
i
haven

t
seen
phantom

in
mayb
ten
year
but
look
back
at
the
clip
i
saw
there
doesn
’
t
seem
be
that
same
kind
of
tension
and
excit
there
wa
so
much
spin
and
flail
that
none
of
their
attack
seem
veri
signific
thi
is
someth
that
plinkett
did
mention
plu
the
darth
maul
battl
wa
initi
two
on

which
kind
of
make
him
the
underdog
even
if
he
is
a
realli
power
sith
lord
with
a
doubl
lightsab
if
you
made
mike
tyson
fight
two
inferior
but
accomplish
contend
at
the
same
time
you
’
d
probabl
expect
tyson
to
lose
even
if
he
had
horsesho
in
hi
glove
jesu
suck
gay
peni
thi
is
quit
good
it
’
s
hard
to
find
fault
in
most
of
hi
point
i
suspect
he
might
be
a
crimin
though
thoma

i
see
what
you
’

tri
to
say
but
it
still
work
as
an

becaus
peopl

a

crazi
about

still
one
of

who
come
to

when
they
hear

d
thought
the
answer
wa
obviou
jager
i
just
like
the
concept
of
a
deflector
shield
instead
of
shield
be
a
littl
blue
bar
of
abl
hp
so
defend
the
concept
instead
of
the
movi
i
guess
ispyrori
when
i
first
saw
the
phantom
menac
i
can
rememb
defend
the
awesom
choreographi
of
the
darth
maul

becaus
it
wa
the
onli
part
of

that
i
found

recogn
how
littl
merit
it
had
for
the

stori
thank
asshol
i
must
conced
that

wa
a
total
irredeem
piec
of

even
then
the
onli
choreographi
that

is
darth
maul
himself
obi
wan
and
qui
gonn
are
just
so
sloppi
in

everi
time
they
turn
around
to
make
a

that
will
function
do
no

damag
than
if
they
didn

audienc
hmmm
…
dean
mcintosh
in
the
film
they
were
tri
to
commun
that
the
jedi
were
after
thousand
of
year
of
there
be
no
sith
they
were
unprepar
to
deal
with
enemi
that
might
wield
lightsabr
against
them
there
’
s
also
lightsabr
physic
revolv
around
how
the
mechan
by
which
they
work
caus
them
to
be
extrem
unstabl
in
the
hand
of
peopl
who
lack
the
forc
the
implic
be
that
darth
maul
kick
so
much
ars
that
he
can
wield
a
weapon
that
is
more
than
twice
as
complic
to
use
and
do
so
more
effect
than
two
jedi
with
simpler
weapon
ye
i
know
thi
is
all
stuff
from
encyclopedia
and
such
shite
but
that
is
part
of
my
point
luca
reli
so
much
on
thi
expand
univers
encyclopedia
stuff
that
he
say
no
longer
count
to
explain
away
what
wa
hi
job
as
the
director
to
tell
us
iron
if
a
director
had
found
a
good
way
to
explain
to
us
that
lightsabr
have
a
gyroscop
effect
and
cannot
be
wield
by
just
anybodi
whilst
at
the
same
time
explain
how
han
wa
abl
to
cut
open
a
tauntaun
with
one
in
spite
of
that
that
would
be
just
compet
filmmak
good
filmmak
if
they
do
it
well
the
scene
in
robocop
where
they
are
assembl
robocop
whilst
hi
“
viewpoint
”
see
them
“
it
’
s
titanium
lamin
with
kevlar
”
are
an
exampl
of
thi
kind
of
exposit
done
like
a
boss
luca
ha
never
work
with
anyon
good
enough
to
do
it
that
well
but
even
a
quarter
of
the
way
would
have
been
better
than
what
we
got
even
with
a
good
explan
like
that
thi
would
not
negat
the
fact
that
all
three
particip
in
the
duel
violat
the
first
rule
of
fenc
and
do
so
repeatedli
that
is
never
show
your
oppon
your
back
dean
mcintosh
when
i
wa
younger
i
had
a
similar
mindset
i
would
defend
tpm
zealous
even
though
i
had
veri
littl
basi
from
the
actual
film
to
defend
it
with
and
the
more
i
began
to
write
stori
of
my
own
write
thing
then
pick
them
apart
and
put
them
back
togeth
and
just
tri
to
assembl
someth
that
a
profession
artist
would
be
keen
to
publish
rather
than
send
back
and
tell
me
wa
crap
the
more
i
realis
i
realis
that
everyth
plinkett
say
in
thi
video
is
spot
on
given
how
long
between
return
and
phantom
luca
had
it
baffl
me
that
he
wa
in
such
a
rush
to
get
a
script
finish
it
remind
me
of
that
statement
about
videogam
a
stori
is
late
until
it
is
releas
but
it
suck
forev
simpli
delay
the
releas
by
a
year
or
two
and
give
the
script
to
someon
who
can
write
a
good
stori
would
have
save
tpm
abov
i
wrote
in
respons
to
a
comment
by
alex
lee
in
my
respons
i
write
how
one
can
simpli
expect
an
audienc
to
automat
know
someth
or
wors
yet
expect
them
to
read
up
about
it
in
a
canon
guid
that
a
scant
fifteen
year
later
you
will
tell
them
is
invalid
that
is
what
luca
essenti
did
here
no
explan
other
than
how
you
test
posit
for
jedi
is
offer
concern
the
mechan
of
the
star
war
univers
that
is
veri
veri
bad
storytel
sinc
i
use
the
exampl
of
robocop
abov
i
will
repeat
it
here
in
five
minut
flat
paul
and
ed
explain
everyth
that
the
audienc
need
to
know
in
order
to
not
onli
have
it
make
sens
but
for
it
to
be
one
of
the
most
awesom
time
one
can
have
passiv
watch
imag
tpm
by
comparison
give
us
“
oh
let
me
administ
thi
blood
test
hey
congratul
you
are
a
jedi
”
and
noth
els
even
when
the
fan
might
want
it
we
see
noth
of
how
jedi
are
train
under
optim
circumst
how
lightsabr
work
or
even
what
make
a
person
want
to
becom
a
jedi
in
fact
that
last
one
is
a
realli
sore
point
you
see
all
that
the
prequel
have
succeed
in
is
make
the
peopl
who
were
suppos
to
be
good
guy
in
the
other
three
film
look
like
asshol
that
nobodi
in
their
right
mind
would
want
to
be
in
the
prequel
jedi
are
peopl
that
i
would
cut
down
with
my
lightsabr
if
i
caught
them
anywher
near
my
nephew
or
niec
and
that
is
all
thank
to
georg
luca
’
exquisit
bad
storytel
in
other
plinkett
review
he
say
“
let
’
s
stop
and
think
about
thi
for
a
second
”
or
word
to
that
effect
at
least
onc
i
would
urg
you
to
do
the
same
dean
mcintosh
thoma
i
would
like
to
wrap
your
comment
up
in
a
bow
and
send
them
to
one
poster
just
abov
you
on
thi
page
i
just
want
to
chuck
in
my
penni
about
a
coupl
of
thing
you
write
i
think
the
same
effect
the
who
care
what
is
happen
effect
occur
in
peter
jackson
’
s
middl
earth
in
name
onli
film
i
wa
watch
a
lot
of
the
make
of
around
the
time
that
the
home
video
releas
were
occur
and
one
thing
i
could
not
get
past
no
matter
how
i
tri
wa
all
of
the
brag
about
how
these
big
battl
sequenc
were
50
minut
long
and
had
thousand
of
charact
involv
when
i
wa
look
over
the
finish
product
mani
thing
came
to
mind
one
he
wa
lie
when
he
said
charact
there
’
s
mayb
one
or
two
charact
in
each
film
that
the
audienc
is
given
enough
reason
to
care
about
and
the
rest
of
the
battl
is
basic
anonym
figur
in
a
comput
kill
each
other
in
videogam
way
second
and
thi
is
what
i
want
to
touch
on
in
term
of
the
empir
duel
the
stori
doe
not
progress
one
iota
whilst
these
protract
battl
sequenc
take
place
it
is
as
if
the
stori
stop
dead
while
good
stereotyp
guy
murder
the
shit
out
of
bad
stereotyp
guy
empir
achiev
someth
that
i
have
onli
seen
duplic
in
one
other
film
that
i
can
rememb
13
assassin
as
the
duel
and
escap
fight
progress
you
learn
new
thing
about
the
charact
you
learn
that
there
is
a
point
that
push
lando
past
will
get
him
to
turn
on
you
even
when
you
have
him
by
the
proverbi
you
learn
that
leia
realli
is
in
love
with
han
and
most
importantli
you
learn
that
luke
and
vader
are
not
just
play
fenc
like
children
at
the
start
of
that
duel
i
could
not
help
but
think
vader
must
be
think
“
if
i
did
not
need
thi
suit
just
to
exist
i
would
hand
thi
boy
hi
ars
in
no
time
”
then
as
luke
use
the
forc
to
escap
trap
vader
adjust
hi
strategi
around
the
fact
that
luke
might
not
be
complet
incompet
after
all
the
moment
when
vader
is
use
the
forc
to
throw
stuff
at
luke
batter
him
are
all
about
soften
luke
up
for
take
to
the
emperor
but
the
real
fusion
of
storytel
with
visual
excit
is
that
quick
moment
where
luke
hit
a
hit
into
vader
that
make
him
say
ouch
then
quickli
retali
by
cut
luke
’
s
hand
off
we
see
that
had
luke
exercis
some
patienc
and
not
given
in
to
the
vision
of
hi
friend
be
tortur
the
outcom
of
the
fight
might
have
been
veri
differ
he
learn
enough
along
the
way
to
at
least
remind
vader
that
vader
is
not
invulner
i
will
be
brief
about
jedi
that
score
music
where
we
hear
the
bariton
men
wordlessli
hum
tell
more
stori
than
anyth
go
on
in
the
other
two
segment
of
the
battl
put
togeth
it
tell
the
audienc
“
oh
no
everyth
the
last
few
jedi
have
been
strive
for
for
the
past
five
or
six
hour
is
gone
mayb
forev
”
it
is
the
star
war
equival
of
the
moment
in
robocop
where
robocop
is
angrili
stride
out
of
hi
rest
chamber
with
scienc
men
vainli
urg
him
to
stop
call
me
what
you
like
but
i
actual
enjoy
jedi
slightli
more
than
ani
other
sw
film
for
that
part
alon
but
the
point
of
all
that
is
that
it
prove
plinkett
is
right
about
the
duel
they
are
not
about
fight
but
rather
the
stori
that
lead
into
them
and
the
stori
that
lead
into
the
tpm
duel
is
crap
no
it
’
s
shit
…
😉
i
do
howev
disagre
about
the
darth
maul
duel
up
to
a
point
there
are
underdog
and
underdog
and
again
thi
is
part
of
what
plinkett
is
talk
about
in
hi
review
about
the
stori
versu
choreographi
ye
i
know
say
“
the
novel
say
…”
is
bonehead
but
hear
me
out
the
text
about
the
duel
talk
about
how
maul
is
alway
in
control
how
after
thi
amount
of
time
the
jedi
are
no
closer
to
win
and
so
forth
but
becaus
we
are
given
no
basi
on
which
to
understand
how
elit
maul
is
suppos
to
be
we
cannot
understand
thing
like
that
from
the
film
what
i
would
have
done
is
have
a
few
scene
in
the
film
where
jedi
are
be
kill
in
group
and
nobodi
know
who
is
do
it
until
maul
pop
out
of
nowher
on
tattooin
and
tri
to
take
down
qui
gon
a
quick
moment
where
five
jedi
are
come
to
the
aid
of
some
unrel
person
and
maul
kill
them
all
anyth
like
that
but
luca
is
and
wa
such
an
idiot
that
he
think
he
can
just
have
one
actor
with
no
charact
develop
whatev
do
flip
and
kick
and
swing
a
two
blade
sabr
and
audienc
will
automat
twig
that
the
jedi
are
come
from
a
place
of
weak
in
thi
battl
it
is
kind
of
like
how
they
do
it
in
the
real
x
men
film
they
make
it
pain
clear
that
the
normi
have
all
the
weapon
control
of
societi
etc
etc
so
the
onli
thing
save
the
mutant
from
doom
is
their
power
a
good
director
like
bryan
singer
or
matthew
vaughn
know
you
do
not
take
it
for
grant
that
an
audienc
know
or
understand
thing
like
that
hell
a
vagu
compet
directli
know
not
to
take
it
for
grant
so
i
submit
to
you
that
in
the
hand
of
a
good
director
the
audienc
would
have
known
that
darth
maul
is
the
forc
equival
of
bruce
lee
and
qui
gon
obi
wan
are
the
equival
of
newli
mint
black
belt
in
that
context
the
audienc
should
have
been
surpris
that
qui
gon
last
for
as
long
as
he
did
everyon
can
chew
me
out
at
their
leisur
for
say
it
but
the
thing
luca
did
not
explicitli
spell
out
on
the
screen
such
as
maul
’
s
true
abil
or
the
oper
physic
of
lightsabr
are
what
seal
him
as
an
incompet
dickhead
not
what
he
did
put
on
the
screen
alex
lee
“
thi
would
not
negat
the
fact
that
all
three
particip
in
the

do
so
repeatedli
that
is
never
show
your
oppon

”
thi
is
whi
there
’
s
no
tension
in
the
fight
i
’
m
just
judg
it
base
on
what
is
present
but
mani
peopl
such
as
the
nostalgia
critic
just
think
it
’
s
a
kick
ass
sword
fight
when
it
realli
isn
’
t
andrew
thompson
am
i
the
onli
one

made

…
but
now
want
to
shove
it
up
georg
ars
andrew
thompson
shame
you
didnt
make
that
comment
10
year
ago
when
the
charact
wa
invent
…
dean
mcintosh
there
is
also
a
funni
littl
detail
that
luca
invalid
with
hi
“
eu
is
not

”
edict
that
say
lightsabr
cosmet
relat
to
person
histori
if
you
look
at
qui
gon
’
s
older
obi
wan
’
s
and
luke
’
s
rotj
lightsabr
you
notic
they
have
a
lot
in
common
the
same
is
true
of
anakin
’
s
vader
’
s
lightsabr
next
to
yoda
’
s
but
i
digress
i
am
probabl
the
onli
person
who
took
ani
notic
of
that
whilst
watch
tpm
or
ani
prequel
at
the
premier
the
fact
that
i
took
notic
of
it
dure
these
duel
say
a
lot
about
me
and
the
duel
heh
probabl
the
moment
that
came
off
the
worst
for
me
in
the
naboo
duel
howev
wa
when
maul
awkwardli
balanc
himself
on
the
edg
of
a
platform
block
both

backflip

that
ha
got
to
be
at

a
long
jump

away
from
him
i
mean
the
other
shot
in
the
duel
i
can
sort
of
at

understand

“

i

like
twice
and

what
the

is
go

in

it

and

at

glad
i

not
the

one
i

believ
thi
is
aim
at

what
kid
in
their

care
about
space
tax
and
trade
disput
i
love
star

but
it
liter
lost
the
plot
with
thi
orvil
ketchum
i
agre
with
most
of
what
you
wrote
here
and
think
you
did
a
good
job
in
make
your
argument
i
do
disagre
with
your
final
argument
in
a
small
way
the
reason
whi
the
duel
in
empir
work
is
becaus
we
know
that
vader
is
a
power
and
corrupt
charact
and
that
luke
is
essenti
an
up
and
comer
they
never
made
thi
statement
in
the
movi
yet
the
audienc
know
thi
without
it
be
spell
out
vader
use
the
forc
to
choke
a
command
offic
to
death
in
front
of
anoth
offic
…
while
he
’
s
promot
him
to
the
posit
of
the
man
who
’
s
liter
die
next
to
him
thi
wasn
’
t
for
laugh
thi
wa
to
drive
home
what
the
stake
are
and
who
vader
is
hi
power
and
willing
to
util
it
thi
also
inform
the
audienc
that
he
’
s
in
control
now
and
there
’
s
no
grand
moff
tarkin
to
pull
the
leash
on
him
and
we
’
re
remind
of
thi
when
anoth
command
lose
track
of
the
falcon
goe
to
apologist
and
is
kill
for
hi
effort
when
you
see
luke
struggl
to
maintain
control
over
the
object
he
’
s
levit
while
hi
mind
is
flood
with
imag
of
hi
friend
endur
a
lot
of
pain
we
know
that
he
’
s
not
as
power
as
vader
and
the
audienc
wonder
how
he
’
s
go
to
overcom
thi
challeng
in
the
phantom
menanc
in
order
for
the
fight
scene
in
the
end
to
matter
i
would
have
shown
the
jedi
’
s
spar
with
each
other
jin
duel
anoth
jedi
who
’
s
clearli
better
and
is
a
step
faster
kenobi
’
s
spar
with
a
fourth
jedi
and
is
dispatch
even
faster
they
don
’
t
even
need
to
say
anyth
cute
like
“
you
’
re
train
him
your
student

in

”
later
these
two
jedi
’
s
shown
in
addit
scene
as
the

progress
and
is
shown
to
be
the
prefer
pair
to
send
on
mission
are
attack
and
defeat
by
darth
horn

you
don

accomplish
someth
els
between
the
spar
and
their
death
to
reinforc
the
idea
that
their
victori
were
not

in

to
save
the

menac
you
pretti

the

it

a

so
qui

put

well
he
influenc
the

to
make

anakin
’

freedom
but
in

ordinarili
and
in
thi

winner
take
all
–
so
they
actual
still
had
the
pod
and
anakin
’

freedom
in

there
’

even
a
scene
where
anakin
run

all

like
“

whi

then
if

raynor

that

jack

of

and
pre

lawra

holi
shit
you
’

right
it
’
s
hard
to
recogn
him
with
a

and

now
i
feel
like
an
idiot
tom
gattenhof
it
’
s
jack
packard
from
pre
rec
and
a
lot
of
the
best
of
the
worst
video
onli
with
more
hair
darknstormi
when
you
have
enough
money
power
to
do
anyth
nobodi
on
your
pay
role
is
go
to
argu
with
you
especi
if
you
at
the
time
were
consid
one
of
the
god
of
film
leann
there
’
s
just
so
much
wrong
with
thi
movi
that
it
’
s
imposs
to
cover
all
of
it
even
in
a
70
min
review
you
can
talk
about
all
the
major
thing
but
then
when
you
get
right
down
to
it
even
seemingli
minor
issu
turn
out
to
have
major
implic
take
the
bongo
ride
through
the
planet
core
for
exampl
i
get
that
in
scienc
fantasi
like
star
war
you
have
to
suspend
your
disbelief
a
littl
but
like
plinkett
say
in
the
episod
ii
review
you
can
’
t
stretch
the
rule
of
realiti
too
far
or
it
becom
ridicul
first
of
all
to
get
down
far
enough
to
even
reach
the
planet
’
s
crust
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
the
bongo
would
have
to
be
abl
to
withstand
enorm
amount
of
pressur
as
would
the
peopl
insid
of
it
next
you
have
the
issu
of
not
onli
have
to
dig
a
tunnel
through
the
center
of
the
planet
in
order
to
make
thi
kind
of
travel
possibl
but
actual
then
travel
through
it
thi
onli
work
if
the
entir
planet
ha
no
molten
layer
or
a
core
that
is
extrem
hot
and
extrem
pressur
so
you
could
argu
that
naboo
is
an
entir
cool
solid
chunk
of
rock
except
for
the
fact
that
a
hot
core
is
actual
necessari
to
maintain
a
magnet
field
around
the
planet
and
support
life
consid
again
the
fact
that
it
also
make
no
sens
for
the
droid
armi
to
even
land
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
from
their
target
you
’
d
think
that
if
luca
wa
realli
dead
set
on
them
meet
the
gungan
and
take
a
secret
underwat
craft
to
get
to
the
citi
he
’
d
just
have
the
underwat
citi
be
off
the
coast
of
theed
or
someth
and
besid
all
that
scienc
stuff
whi
would
the
gungan
have
thi
planet
core
passag
that
lead
directli
to
theed
anyway
sinc
they
don
’
t
exactli
seem
to
get
along
with
the
human
on
the
planet
veri
well
whi
would
they
even
want
or
need
that
my
onli
guess
is
that
they
want
to
connect
with
anoth
gungan
settlement
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
but
we
never
see
or
hear
about
one
i
don
’
t
know
thi
is
a
film
for
babi
so
mayb
it
’
s
suppos
to
appeal
to
the
kid
in
all
of
us
who
thought
they
’
d
end
up
in
china
if
they
dug
a
hole
deep
enough
in
the
backyard
or
someth
leann
my
guess
is
that
hand
motion
just
make
it
easier
you
’
d
probabl
have
to
concentr
a
lot
harder
to
move
thing
with
your
mind
without
it
even
in
the
origin
we
see
it
done
both
way
luke
is
abl
to
levit
c
3po
while
hi
hand
are
tie
but
we
also
see
yoda
use
hi
hand
when
lift
the
x
wing
out
of
the
swamp
and
vader
almost
alway
hold
out
hi
hand
when
do
a
forc
choke
also
the
littl
hand
wave
serv
as
an
easi
visual
clue
to
the
audienc
that
the
forc
is
be
use
plu
i
think
it
wa
also
a
callback
to
the
handwav
obi
wan
did
when
he
use
the
mind
trick
in
a
new
hope
leann
i
think
the
point
he
wa
tri
to
make
wa
not
that
the
ship
get
damag
again
after
the
shield
is
fix
but
that
no
one
even
appear
to
fire
on
them
again
the
shot
would
’
ve
been
deflect
true
but
ultim
the
shield
still
doe
noth
becaus
right
after
it
’
s
fix
they
fli
away
without
be
attack
again
which
dissolv
all
the
tension
in
the
scene
franki
furbo
you
“
can
’
t
imagin
a
reason
argument
for
him
to
be
the
protagonist
”
becaus
you
’
re
onli
imagin
the
charact
from
the
way
he
appear
in
the
final
film
in
the
origin
draft
of
tpm
most
of
qui
gon
’
s
action
were
transfer
to
obi
wan
obi
wa
the
onli
jedi
sent
to
deal
with
the
blockad
at
the
begin
and
the
stori
follow
him
to
naboo
gungan
citi
planet
core
thebe
tatooin
all
the
way
to
corusc
where
qui
gon
final
enter
the
pictur
from
then
on
qui
gon
’
s
role
is
similar
to
the
finish
film
in
almost
all
refer
to
the
prequel
trilog
pre
1995
georg
state
the
prequel
trilog
would
basic
follow
the
stori
of
obi
wan
which
it
larg
doe
and
anakin
…
he
even
said
thi
befor
he
decid
to
make
anakin
and
darth
vader
the
same
person
obi
wan
is
a
main
charact
in
not
onli
the
entir
saga
but
specif
the
prequel
so
it
make
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
sens
to
give
the
principl
action
to
obi
wan
than
a
throwaway
charact
who
exist
pure
to
die
he
should
’
ve
trust
hi
first
instinct
there
but
i
guess
he
want
us
to
feel
some
real
stake
when
qui
gon
die
so
he
need
more
screen
time
i
’
m
guess
you
grew
up
with
the
prequel
and
if
that
’
s
the
case
i
can
see
where
it
would
be
hard
to
imagin
a
world
where
obi
wan
’
s
charact
might
have
been
repres
differ
than
it
wa
in
the
prequel
trilog
if
not
i
’
m
surpris
you
can
’
t
imagin
how
it
all
could
’
ve
been
written
differ
rememb
there
wa
a
time
when
the
star
war
backstori
wa
a
mere
outlin
larg
undevelop
and
the
charact
could
’
ve
been
written
differ
gl
certainli
start
with
the
idea
of
make
obi
wan
an
establish
jedi
knight
rather
than
a
padawan
the
open
scroll
even
call
obi
wan
a
jedi
knight
so
appar
gl
forgot
to
amend
it
after
switch
the
action
to
obi
wan
despit
hi
numer
attempt
at
reinforc
the
facad
that
he
had
the
entir
stori
plan
from
the
begin
in
realiti
luca
wa
just
make
it
all
up
as
he
went
along
sure
the
way
it
turn
out
the
charact
is
subordin
to
qui
gon
and
less
suit
to
be
the
protagonist
but
it
didn
’
t
have
to
be
that
way
benignview
you
know
someth
els
funni
i
just
notic
when
the

were
sneak
around

they
could
have
just
snuck
up
on

destroy
the

in

you

have

if

realli
want
then
instead
of

instead
go

he

right
there
in

he
doesn

know
you

what
possibl

would
you
have

not
just
free
some

for

or
just
get
the
viceroy
while

if

over

like

benignview
the

for
someon

someth
of

origin
–
they
use
it
in
the
film
when
watto
and
qui
gon
refer
to
the
queen
’
s
ship
as
‘
nubian
’
vicar
in

the
one
save
grace
is
that
these
movi
realli
didn

t
age
well
and
the
onli
group
with
ani
kind
nostalgia
for
them
are
mostli
milleni
they
have
no
redeem
qualiti
for
anyon
els
and
if
abram
doesn
’
t
fuck
up
the

one
too
badli
then
kid
in
the
futur
might
just
ignor
the

all
togeth
of

i
’
m
probabl
be
way
too
optimist
benignview
we
can
hope
nonetheless
hilari
manfat
from
the
trailer
i
get
the
impress
that
abram
know
what
he
’
s
do
but
the
film
look
like
it
will
be
flatter
by
the
poor
prequel
i
’
ve
got
a
feel
that
the
new
movi
will
be
akin
to
the
star
trek
reboot
in
that
they
are
decent
but
not
groundbreak
i
realli
think
that
the
origin
trilog
is
a
“
lightn
in
the
bottl
”
product
of
it
time
and
can
never
be
replic
no

how
hard
anyon
tri
lat
i
can

be
the
onli
one
who
is
complet
baffl
by
obi
wan
come
down
from
the

of

go
into
that

droid
fight
scene
watch

and
you
’

see
him
liter
fall
from

like
he

lat
the
idea
of

is
good
ηρακλης

…
and
who
exactli
argu
with

the

g
kurtz
right
the

who

myth
…
you
’
re
actual
prais
the
person
who
nearli
destroy
anh
tesb
by
not
keep
them
in

the
person
who
almost
drove
luca
to
death
becaus
of
that
the
person
who
had
no
busi
in
the
creativ
process
of
the
film
kurtz
for
decad
ha
spun
thi
yarn
that
somehow
he
wa
a
co
creator
of
star
war
and
deserv
much
of
the
prais
for
anh
and
tesb
unfortun
he
’
s
had
a
readi
audienc
of
ot
onli
fan
who
have
conclud
that
luca
jump
the
shark
and
kurtz
must
have
reign
him
in
yeah
that
would
be
neat
if
it
were
all
true
but
it
’
s
not
all
peopl
have
to
do
is
look
at
kurtz
and
luca
’
track
record
after
their
“
divorc
”
to
reveal
the
truth
post
empir
kurtz
ha
two
major
studio
film
to
hi
name
the
dark
crystal
and
return
to
oz
interestingli
in
both
case
the
studio
want
kurtz
fire
becaus
both
film
were
wildli
over
budget
and
behind
schedul
and
the
dark
crystal
end
the
friendship
between
kurtz
and
jim
henson
becaus
kurtz
kept
tri
to
insert
himself
into
the
creativ
process
and
the
dark
crystal
wa
henson
’
s
babi
now
to
show
you
what
kind
of
an
a
hole
luca
is
luca
went
to
disney
and
lobbi
to
studio
to
keep
both
hi
friend
walter
murch
as
director
and
kurtz
as
execut
produc
despit
disney
want
to
fire
kurtz
on
the
spot
luca
supervis
the
end
of
the
product
and
gave
the
studio
some
of
hi
own
money
as
insur
…
boy
that
luca
sure
in
a
jerk
post
oz
no
one
in
the
studio
would
touch
kurtz
with
a
30
foot
electr
cattl
prod
becaus
the
man
simpl
could
not
keep
big
budget
movi
under
control
…
just
look
at
the
list
star
war
empir
dark
crystal
return
to
oz
and
i
’
m
sure
that
had
to
grind
hi
gear
becaus
after
all
he
wa
the
line
produc
on
two
of
the
most
success
film
of
all
time
meanwhil
luca
continu
to
churn
out
hit
after
hit
and
success
grew
a
compani
he
had
envis
when
kurtz
wa
still
a
part
of
the
team
so
let
establish
a
coupl
of
thing
here
luca
and
kurtz
were
not
best
bud
if
you
look
at
luca
like
most
peopl
he

he

in
fact
luca

have
been

for

he
clearli

heck
the
evid
that
luca
and
kurtz
were
never

can
be
found
in

coppola
coppola
and
luca
had
an
enorm

public
fall
out
mainli
base
on
coppola
’

resent
of
luca

success
coppola
said
as
much
but
that
relationship
wa
patch
up
long
ago
and
they
remain
close

to
thi
day
kurtz
wa
never

exampl
that
come
to

is
the

there
is
a

made
to

execut
of

be

their
univers
they
don
’
t
say
“
god
god
spirit
want
us
to
do
thi
”
they
say
we
must
do
like
thi
becaus
we
know
how
thi
forc
thing
work
and
how
it
can
affect
our
mind
otherwis
plu
our
reason
lead
us
to
the
conclus
that
thi
is
a
good
thing
to
do
carpent
e
yoda
often
doesn
’
t
speak
like
yoda
“
hate
lead
to
suffer
”
should
be
“
lead
to
suffer
hate
doe
”
which
mean
that
he
sometim
ha
a
grasp
of
the
languag
and
sometim
he
doesn
’
t
–
old
age
can
do
that
to
a
muppet
–
or
he
just
think
it
’
s
fun
to
speak
with
the
grammar
from
hi
own
languag
sometim
while
other
time
he
forget
about
it
carpent
e
yep
the
second
of
the
first
movi
wa
direct
by
hi
teacher
from
movi
make
school
whatev
you
call
it
it
wa
a
great
product
and
luca
got
all
the
credit
so
then
he
had
a
heavier
hand
in
the
third
movi
–
give
us
forest
troll
defeat
the
top
top
top
fighter
of
the
galaxi
span
empir
by
the
way
those
ewok
first
they
are
go
to
eat
other
intellig
be
who
they
have
captur
which
is
just
as
horrif
as
cannib
the
littl
monster
onli
halt
their
plan
becaus
they
are
fool
into
think
c3po
is
a
god
thi
decept
goe
on
so
they
human
can
remain
uneaten
they
decid
to
get
back
at
the
ewok
by
use
them
in
a
war
against
other
human
a
war
they
have
no
part
in
the
ewok
fight
and
die
without
know
whi
becaus
they
think
c3po
is
a
god
and
he
tell
them
to
i
don
’
t
know
whether
to
despis
the
monster
or
piti
them
carpent
e
jar

and
you
are

thi
carpent
e
aww
fallaci
claim
well
that
doe
make
you
sound
more
intellectu
than

so
then
it
must
be
true
carpent
e
well
there
are
reboot
for
everyth
these
day
batman
will
have
yet
anoth
reboot
for
exampl
so
mayb
we
can
get
a
prequel
reboot
thi
time
with
a
mute
jar
jar
bink
who
drown
when
he
jump
into
the
water
and
then
qui
gon
and
obi
wan
just
keep
walk
along
the

until
they
reach
the

a
few
leagu

they
never
did
give
osamu

hi
kimba
the

–
i

wow
you

mayb
if
you
keep

up
he
’

invit
you
to

someth

i
don
’
t
think
anyon
who
visit
thi
site
actual
read
what
you
write
asid
from
a
quick
glanc
they
watch
the
video
instead
all
your
frantic
effort
for
naught
carpent
e
they
should
have
just
summon
bigger
fish
and
drop
on
the
viceroy
like
they
obvious
did
dure
the
ocean
trip
twice
a
monster
fish
wa
go
to
eat
them
and
an
even
bigger
monster
fish
show
up
to
eat
it
twice
that
’
s
some
seriou
forc
summon
there
steven
brumley
see
my
feel
is
that
luca
didn
’
t
direct
the
empir
strike
back
or
return
of
the
jedi
becaus
he
knew
he
got
lucki
with
a
new
hope
if
empir
suck
and
if
he
wasn
’
t
direct
it
then
he
wouldn
’
t
look
so
bad
and
peopl
wouldn
’
t
blame
him
so
much
same
with
return
of
the
jedi
but
i
think
the
origin
trilog
of
movi
were
done
and
after
all
those
year
had
pass
then
he
want
to
write
and
direct
the
prequel
so
he
could
prove
to
himself
that
he
wa
a
good
writer
and
director
nobodi
the
world
over
doubt
hi
abil
to
write
and
direct
the
prequel
it
wa
just
assum
that
he
could
do
it
after
all
he
wa
respons
for
the
1st
movi
so
after
all
those
year
he
decid
that
he
want
to
write
and
direct
those
movi
so
that
he
could
banish
that
nag
feel
insid
himself
that
he
wasn
’
t
that
good
well
it
turn
out
he
’
s
not
that
good
of
a
writer
and
he
’
s
not
that
good
of
a
director
the
fan
beat
him
up
pretti
bad
and
they
still
continu
to
take
punch
at
him
after
all
these
year
but
the
one
person
that
probabl
is
hardest
on
him
when
he
sit
alon
at
night
is
probabl
himself
becaus
now
he
know
that
he
’
s
not
that
good
of
writer
and
director
he
will
have
to
live
with
that
to
hi
grave
i
will
give
him
thi
though
he
may
not
be
a
good
writer
or
director
but
he
is
the
best
produc
in
the
game
and
an
excel
all
around
busi
man
becaus
when
he
produc
a
movi
you
can
guarante
that
everi
penni
that
is
spent
is
seen
on
the
screen
and
noth

i

a

and
it
sure
as
hell
wasn

t
my
choic
it
’
s
just
anoth
one
of
the
1001
reason
the

is
so
bad

look
to

we
have
the

wasn

that
great
just
look
at

luca
agre
to
that

he

the

the

so
did

both

and
your

no

how

just

spielburg
is
visibl
frustrat
talk
about

push
for
that
stupid
“

plot
nope
i
suggest
you
visit
a
psychologist
about
your
luca
derang
syndrom
befor
you
look
at
these
interview
see
thing
that
aren
’
t
there
…
brandon
marshal
except
that
thi
is
from
the
writer
who
thought
that
parsec
wa
a
measur
of
time
i
don
’
t
give
a
shit
how
anyon
ha
retroact
made
up
for
thi
gaff
by
state
that
the
cassel
run
is
through
black
hole
and
it
about
how
short
of
a
flight
you
can
make
it
it
wa
a
gaff
and
i
love
the
origin
trilog
but
sometim
when
peopl
delv
into
scienc
fiction
they
don
’
t
understand
everyth
point
is
there
is
no
way
luca
had
ani
concept
of
an
artifici
magnet
field
gener
for
a
planet
that
didn
’
t
have
a
natur
one
so
peopl
could
live
there
not
to
mention
that
the
polit
between
the
naboo
and
the
gungan
would
not
support
thi
at
all
as
we
are
made
to
believ
that
the
gungan
are
essenti
‘
nativ
’
of
the
planet
while
the
naboo
may
be
transplant
lovesw_prequel
of
cours
but
my
origin
point
wa
about
luca
’
mindset
by
includ
it
xianiti
is
obv
what
most
peopl
are
familiar
with
and
i
’
d
bet
luca
wasn
’
t
think
about
ani
of
the
old
religion
can
i
say
“
antiquit
religion
”
wa
gonna
counter
your
25cent
word
there
blade57hrc
and
your
point
about
luca
’
suppos
mindset
is
base
on
your
preconcept
s
so
don
’
t
bet
on
anyth
parthenogenesi
is
veri
common
in
myth
which
is
were
luca
draw
hi
pattern
from
which
is
not
steal
order
66
is
not
666
and
12
parsec
is
not
12
apostl
either
lol
i
don
’
t
rememb
thi
precis
plinkett
”

i
don

ani
of
those
”

”
i
actual
do

when
someon

a

year

i
fell
into
thi
plinkett
trap
and
convinc
myself
that
the
pt
wa
crap
problem
here
is
later
that
same
year
i
re
watch
the
movi
and
the
bt
stuff
and
read
some
sw
book
and
realis
stoklasa
arguement
were
basic
bullcrap
and
that
if
one
look
at
the
ot
with
the

cynic
it
ha
twice
the
problem
than
the
pt
ever
did
that
said
it
all
come
down
to
prefer
i
prefer
the
more
suggest
natur
of
the
pt
vs
the
more
simplist
spoon
feed
natur
of
the
ot
and
also
find
a
2half
senat
speech
more
engag
than
the
mf
escap
a
sd
by
go
slightli
left
i
can
respect
someon
els
s
prefer
but
when
he
she
assert
that
as

of

and

do
i

plain

becaus
the
subtext
is
say
that
if

would

they
’

think
what
you

so
i
don

in

i

anakin

him
becaus
the

told
him
he

itself
make
no

becaus
their

anakin

someth
along

of
“

the

repli
“
i

i

reversalmushroom
it
’
s
not
wrong
almost
everi
set
if
not
everi
set
wa
a
blue
green
room
palpatin
said
that
the
dark
side
could
save
padm
and
then
when
anakin
ask
about
it
after
he
help
palpatin
kill
mace
windu
palpatin
said
he
didn
’
t
know
how
but
wa
sure
that
they
could
find
out
that
should
have
immedi
made
him
turn
against
palpatin
how
wa
what
i
said
stupid
that
’
s
what
a
real
person
in
that
situat
would
do
and
he
wasn
’
t
play
along
none
of
those
thought
occur
to
him
ever
he
could
’
ve
play
along
and
then
as
soon
as
he
left
told
all
the
jedi
about
him
in
the
like
event
that
he
couldn
’
t
control
himself
at
that
realiz
a
realist
charact
wouldn
’
t
care
and
would
rather
die
padm
wa
due
to
give
birth
soon
so
whi
did
anakin
believ
that
they
could
both
unlock
the
secret
of
the
forc
and
kill
all
those
peopl
in
such
a
short
amount
of
time
whi
would
anakin
even
believ
a
person
like
that
and
a
stranger
would
actual
help
him
and
wasn
’
t
just
lie
to
him
to
use
him
whi
couldn
’
t
they
with
their
advanc
technolog
perform
a
cesarean
on
padm
the
onli
reason
he
becam
evil
wa
to
save
padm
so
after
she
die
he
had
no
reason
to
stay
with
palpatin
so
whi
did
he
the
standard
of
write
that
we
all
use
to
determin
bad
write
is
if
the
charact
do
thing
that
make
no
sens
most
peopl
can
’
t
take
a
stori
serious
when
it
make
no
sens
and
empath
with
charact
who
stupidli
make
their
problem
wors
make
themselv
a
burden
on
other
peopl
don
’
t
do
the
obviou
thing
that
would
solv
the
problem
most
peopl
can
’
t
care
about
stori
that
revolv
around
that
if
a
stori
can
onli
exist
becaus
of
how
incompet
it
charact
are
it
’
s
a
bad
stori
if
charact
do
thing
that
make
no
sens
or
don
’
t
do
obviou
thing
that
would
obvious
and
veri
easili
solv
their
problem
it
’
s
bad
write
anakin
and
padm
had
absolut
no
reason
to
fall
in
love
with
each
other
but
onli
did
becaus
georg
luca
said
so
your
point
is
liter
that
i
’
m
appli
logic
to
these
movi
and
i
’
m
wrong
to
do
that
and
that
we
shouldn
’
t
have
standard
and
that
can
should
just
be
abl
to
do
whatev
they
want
with
the
plot
and
charact
no
matter
how
ridicul
it
is
and
that
’
s
the
problem
these
movi
aren
’
t
good
when
you
use
logic
you
probabl
like
the
charact
write
of
modern
south
park
writer
and
fan
that
think
like
you
are
the
reason
whi
the
simpson
south
park
famili
guy
and

spongebob
suck
so
much
ass
now
you
like
it
when
charact
get
wors
i
’
m
glad
that
you
can
enjoy
nonsens
stori
but
my
standard
are
a
bit
higher
than
that
p
s
the
charact
might
not
be
real
peopl
but
charact
in
a
stori
that
is
meant
to
be
taken
serious
should
still
act
like
they
’

may

masterpiec
of

would
have

you
stoklasa
twist
your
panti
at
peopl
make
bad
choic
out
of
passion
and
not
the
”
logic
”
of
an
outsid
viewer
…
now
without
go
into
detail
–
palpatin
wasn
’
t
a
stranger
he
wa
hi
mentor
sinc
he
left
tatooin
and
unlik
obi
palpatin
didn
’
t
scold
him
all
the
time
but
stroke
hi
ego
–
palpatin
said
the
dark
side
could
be
use
to
save
padm
that
’
s
the
how
he
never
claim
to
know
plaguei
secret
of
creat
life
himself
–
palpatin
had
strong
emot
of
fear
at
the
time
have
you
ever
f
cking
been
in
a
stituat
where
someon
close
to
you
is
about
to
die
i
have
more
than
a
handful
it
’
s
no
picnic
palpatin
would
sens
that
–
if
anakin
didn
’
t
join
palpatin
he
would
be
kill
or
risk
be
kill
by
order
66
which
would
follow
sinc
palpatin
knew
the
jedi
had
found
out
about
him
–
the
babi
were
deliv
becaus
she
wa
die
it
wasn
’
t
”
veri
soon
”
–
there
wa
noth
to
go

to
anakin
alway
want
to
”
fix
”
thing
and
in
case
you
miss
it
he
wa
well
into

no
my
point
wa
that
you

do
you

want

thi
even

they

it
is
without

the

from

it

exposit
for
what
you

everyth
in

the
sw

is
made
with

in

who
aren

by

preconcept
btw
were
we
told
how
the
rebel
stole
the
plan
for
the
ds
were
we
told
how
vader
found
out
luke
wa
hi

were
we
told
how
the

got
all
those
huge
ship
in
rotj
were
we
told
how
palpatin
set
the

etc
etc
all
we
see
is
how
these
thing
unfold
whi
is
all
that
not
problem
to
you
i
know
doubl
standard
we
’

left
think
that

into

not
you
are
hi

howev
is
one
of
mani
thing
you
don
’
t
seem
to
grasp
about
the
origin
trilog
i
grasp
it
perfectli
the
rebel
fell
for
the
trap
becaus
they
were
desper
throughout
the
trilog
the
rebel
are
obvious
in
a
hopeless
struggl
nope
it
wa
suggest
in
the
anh
crawl
that
destroy
the
ds
would
be
a
major
blow
to
the
empir
moral
equip
that
would
lead
to
restor
peac
in
the
galaxi
and
they
do
that
quit
easili
they
suffer
a
few
lose
but
compar
to
the
empir
they
came
out
without
a
scratch
howev
inexplic
we
find
them
in
a
wors
situat
in
tesb
for
unknown
reason
a
situat
they
escap
becaus
of
a
”

”
cannon
that
incapacit

sd
and
that
they
for
some
reason
never
use

and
luke
escap
vader
after
decid
not

in

with

obvious
a

then
out

me
feel
sorri
for
the
empir
lol
they
have
no
chanc
ye
they
did
plenti
they
fall
for
the
trap
becaus
they
want
to
believ
they
can
be
success
and
becaus
they
were
stupid
both
side
were
stupid
for
that
matter
and
ye
palpatin
end
up
be
a
victim
of
hi
own

becaus
that
’

how
the

it
will
destroy

as

he
want
to

palpatin
too
that
’

plenti
more
than

and
at

the

how

you

will
to
make
absurd
leap
to

the

lando
–
a

sterotyp
space
pimp
as
a
gener
ye
you
could
argu
that
lando
is
a
racial
stereotyp

let
’

compar
him
to
the

’

the
neimodian
are
incred

the

that

the

is
lando
could
have
been

by
anyon
he

the

more

to

in

the

everyon
just
talk
about

the

star

is
terribl
at
social
commentari
alway
wa
and
the

are
even
wors
if
you
actual
want
to
dig
into
the
social

aspect
what
is
the

it
’

an
obvious
decad
corrupt
institut
if
one
onli
watch
the

one
would
have
to
conclud
that
palpatin
wa
the
best
thing
that
ever
happen
to
the

i
enjoy
these
thing
much
more
than
han
’
s
stupid
line
tension
made
up
from
a
consantli
maulfunct
ship
becaus
chewi
wa
an
idiot
and
couldn

fix
anyth
again
it
is
made
clear
that
you
don
’
t
like
peopl
who
act
like
peopl
and
a
world
that
feel
real
and
live
in
you
want
everyth
to
be
perfect
and
sleek
and
function
but
you
cannot
understand
feel
fromth
start
of

we
realiz
that
the

are
complet
idiot
they
don

blow
up
the

and
elimin
risk
of
the

be
given
to
the

of

anh
ha
the
biggest
one
of
all
but
again
plot
hole
aren
’
t
the
problem
the
onli
reason
peopl
like
me
pick
on
the
plot
hole
in
the
prequel
is
that
the
plot
is
all
that
’
s
there
the
movi
have
no
emot
depth
or
reson
so
we
at
least
need
a
good
plot
to
make
the
action
movi
stuff
worth
it
now
on
to
your
specif
complaint
they
don
’
t
blow
up
the
ship
becaus
they
want
to
investig
who
’
s
on
board
and
whether
or
not
the
plan
were
transmit
the
rebel
don
’
t
transmit
them
becaus
they
have
no
one
to
transmit
them
to
vader
can
’
t
sens
hi
own
daughter
even
when
she
’

with

they

down

if

onli
off

they

not

while
also
subtli
show
the

of

mostli
visual
narr
it
’
s
an

decad
corrupt
institut
which
is
commonli
how
a

democraci
turn
into
a

that

are
you
awar
that
the

tyrant
wasn

alway
non

are
you
awar
of

like
hipparchu
who

befor
you
seem

i
can
certainli
understand
whi
the

the
‘’

it
probabl
doesn

how
exactli
doe
all
that

a

and
live

a

bad
mainten
from

who
never

r2
wa
abl
to

in
no
time
doe
not
feel
real
or
live
in
are
you
tri
to
insinu
that
the
chancellor
’
s
offic
the
senat
in
corusc
the
capit
of
a
republ
with
amaz
technolog
should
look
like
an
outer
rim
dump
of
a
planet
like
tatooin
do
you
think
obama
’
s
offic
look
like
the
hut
in
africa
lol
btw
the
miniatur
of
industri
territori
in
corusc
had
an
amaz
weather
look
i
suggest
you
watch
the
bt
from
aotc
and
watch
their
construct
sinc
your
hate
probabl
made
you
blind
to
ilm
model
shop
amaz
work
which
wa
sold
year
ago
…
make
one
wonder
how
jj
will
top
the
amaz
practic
work
in
the
prequel
you
want
everyth
to
be
perfect
and
sleek
and
function
but
you
cannot
understand
feel
no
i
want
everyth
to
make
sens
the
capit
of
the
republ
and
republ
planet
in
a
seemingli
first
of
all
ye
the

trilog
ha
plot
hole
and

ha
the
biggest
one
of
all
but
again
plot
hole
aren
’
t
the
problem
they
’
re
not
sinc
when
and
if
so
then
whi
are
you
tri
to
make
a
case
for
the
pt
be
”
bad
”
by
tri
but
fail
to
insinu
that
it
ha
more
plot
hole
which
it
doesn
’
t
than
the
ot
the
onli
reason
peopl
like
me
pick
on
the
plot
hole
in
the
prequel
is
that
the
plot
is
all
that
’
s
there
the
movi
have
no
emot
depth
or
bullcrap
the
movi
have
even
more
emot
depth
that
howev
depend
on
perspect
and
pov
from
my
point
of
view
you
prefer
‘’
all
good
’’
caricatur
that
alway
succeed
’’
i
prefer
muddl
ethic
and
charact
with
flaw
that
have
the
potenti
to

do
no

passion
as
you

are
you
tri
to
insinu
that
the
chancellor
’
s
offic
the
senat
in
corusc
the
capit
of
a
republ
with
amaz
technolog
should
look
like
an
outer
rim
dump
of
a
planet
like
tatooin
no
it
should
look
like
a
place
where
human
be
have
ever
been
and
not
a
comput
simul
i
suggest
you
watch
the
bt
from
aotc
under
no
circumst
will
i
ever
do
that
make
one
wonder
how
jj
will
top
the
amaz
practic
work
in
the
prequel
presum
with
weta
workshop
or
just
by
hire
peopl
who
can
do
practic
effect
work
but
the
prequel
set
a
pretti
low
bar
so
i
’
m
sure
he
can
do
it
without
break
a
sweat
you
said
it
yourself
the
onli
practic
effect
work
that
wa
done
on
the
prequel
wa
a
few
background
the
origin
trilog
had
entir
space
battl
done
practic
and
if
so
then
whi
are
you
tri
to
make
a
case
for
the
pt
be
”
bad
”
by
tri
but
fail
to
insinu
that
it
ha
more
plot
hole
which
it
doesn
’
t
than
the
ot
i
’
m
not
i
’
ve
never
made
that
case
it
’
s
a
bad
movi
and
it
ha
plot
hole
but
plot
hole
don
’
t
make
or
break
a
film
viewer
didn
’
t
notic
the
plot
hole
in
the
origin
star
war
movi
becaus
they
didn
’
t
matter
the
film
wa
amaz
and
that
wa
what
matter
but
the
prequel
have
no
emot
depth
or
reson
so
all
that
’

left
is
the
plot
and
if
all
that
’

left
is
the

you
’
re
go
to
notic
the

hole
i
prefer
muddl
ethic
and
charact
with

that

the
potenti
to

then
go

i

that
you

i
never
read
ani
of
the
prequel
eu
materi
no
interest
in
it
whatsoev
but
it
wa
my
impress
from
the
film
that
when
qui
gon
said
“
we
have
got
to
warn
the
naboo
”
that
it
meant
“
we
have
got
to
warn
the
planet
”
and
that
use
‘
the
’
wa
an
idiosyncrat
facet
of
either
naboo
’
s
cultur
or
the
jedi
themselv
as
both
alway
speak
in
such
formal
languag
gracken
you
can
’
t
see
how
han
and
leia
fell
in
love
realli
he
onli
save
her
life
mike
ha
point
out
plenti
of
mistak
in
the
first
movi
if
you
ever
care
to
pay
attent
the
onli
thing
he
’
s
point
out
are
the
inconsist
in
the
stori
tell
itself
and
if
you
are
like
me
i
have
never
read
ani
of
the
star
war
book
so
although
you
may
be
abl
to
figur
out
what
the
hell
is
go
on
in
the
prequel
becaus
you
alreadi
read
it
in
the
book
tri
watch
the
movi
without
have
read
the
book
they
are
an
incoher
mess
gracken
after
see
the
star
war
holiday
special
i
am
convinc
that
luca
did
not
write
star
war
no
one
will
ever
be
abl
to
convinc
me
other
wise
i
just
wonder
how
much
he
’
s
pay
the
person
that
did
write
it
to
never
say
anyth
lolol
blade57hrc
what
they
are
alreadi
in
love
at
the
start
of
tesb
it
happen
between
the
movi
somehow
she
wasn
’
t
in
love
with
him
in
anh
no
he
’
s
not
that
’
s
what
i
am
point
out
i
haven
’
t
read
the
book
and
i
can
figur
out
what
’
s
go
on
just
fine
all
he
did
wa
ask
question
from
the
book
that
are
trivial
to
understand
the
movi
jonathannathan
read
cloak
of
decept
it
’
s
the
backstori
luca
forgot
to
write
for
episod
i
creox
i
agre
gener
what
i
’
ve
read
even
with
respect
to
american
graffiti
and
sw
anh
is
that
import
signific
chang
were
made
to
the

against
luca
’

wish
that
end
up
make
those
movi
better
in

much
better
with

to
sw
i
like
thx

a

actual
i
wish

of

is
common
knowledg
that

who
regularli
re
wrote

luca
’
s

basic
amount
to
him
be
annoy
that
kurtz
would
not
speed
up

cut
scene
and
cost
kurtz
wa
worri
thi
would
ruin
the

and
instead
implor
kershner

would
not

hurri
the
posit

who

to

kurtz
for

ha
spun
thi
yarn
that
somehow
he
wa
a
co
creator
of
star

and
deserv
much
of
the
prais
for

and
tesb
unfortun
he
’
s
had
a
readi
audienc
of
ot
onli
fan
who
have
conclud
that
luca
jump
the
shark
and
kurtz
must
have
reign
him
in
yeah
that
would
be
neat
if
it
were
all
true
but
it
’
s
not
all
peopl
have
to
do
is
look
at
kurtz
and
luca
’
track
record
after
their
“
divorc
”
to
reveal
the
truth
post
empir
kurtz
ha
two
major
studio
film
to
hi
name
the
dark
crystal
and
return
to
oz
interestingli
in
both
case
the
studio
want
kurtz
fire
becaus
both
film
were
wildli
over
budget
and
behind
schedul
and
the
dark
crystal
end
the
friendship
between
kurtz
and
jim
henson
becaus
kurtz
kept
tri
to
insert
himself
into
the
creativ
process
and
the
dark
crystal
wa
henson
’
s
babi
now
to
show
you
what
kind
of
an
a
hole
luca
is
luca
went
to
disney
and
lobbi
to

to
keep
both
hi
friend
walter
murch
as

and
kurtz
as
execut
produc
despit
disney
want
to

luca
supervis
the
end
of
the
product
and
gave
the

some
of
hi
own
money
as
insur
…
boy
that
luca
sure
is
a
jerk
and
kurtz
such
an
”
unsung
hero
”
right
post
oz
no
one
in
the
studio
would
touch
kurtz
with
a
30
foot
electr
cattl
prod
becaus
the
man
simpl
could
not
keep
big
budget
movi
under
control
…
just
look
at
the
list
star
war
empir
dark
crystal
return
to
oz
and
i
’
m
sure
that
had
to
grind
hi
gear
becaus
after
all
he
wa
the
line
produc
on
two
of
the
most
success
film
of
all
time
meanwhil
luca
continu
to
churn
out
hit
after
hit
and
success
grew
a
compani
he
had
envis
when
kurtz
wa
still
a
part
of
the
team
so
let
establish
a
coupl
of
thing
here
luca
and
kurtz
were
not
best
bud
if
you
look
at
luca
like
most
peopl
he
ha
friend
and
he
ha
busi
partner
co
worker
walter
murch
brian
de
palma
john
miliu
franci
coppola
are
all
friend
in
fact
luca
’
friend
have
been
friend
for
decad
he
clearli
valu
friendship
heck
the
evid
that
luca
and
kurtz
were
never
buddi
can
be
found
in
franci
ford
coppola
coppola
and
luca
had
an
enorm
and
public
fall
out
mainli
base
on
coppola
’
s
resent
of
luca
’
success
coppola
said
as
much
but
that
relationship
wa
patch
up
long
ago
and
they
remain
close
friend
to
thi
day
kurtz
wa
never
in
that
inner
circl
he
wa
a
guy
hire
to
do
a
job
heck
luca
even
attempt
to
“
buri
the
hatchet
”
year
ago
and
invit
him
to
hi
afi
award
dinner
and
involv
him
in
a
number
of
star
war
anniversari
project
even
while
kurtz
wa
bad
mouth
him
on
the
convent
circuit
…
again
man
that
luca
is
a
class
a
jerk
and
kurtz
such
an
”
unsung
hero
”
right
now
kurtz
is
out
there
spin
more
fiction

like
“
fox
wasn
’
t
worri
about
star
war
’
budget
”
serious
what
planet
is
he
from
thi
is
the
same
studio
that
wa
pinch
penni
and
bare
spend
money
on
their
final
movi
in
one
of
their
tentpol
franchis
“
planet
of

”
they
spent
a
whop
grand
total
of
1
7
million
on
battl
for
the
planet
of
the
ape
quit
a
bit
of
that
on
promot
the
actual
product
budget
wa
closer
to
1
million
and
it
show
doe
kurtz
serious
expect
peopl
to
believ
that
fox
wa
not
concern
when
the
budget
move
from
7
5
million
to
10
5

especi
when
