the
best
blockbust
in

the
master

–
see
all
my
review
it
ha
been
12
year
sinc
cameron
unleash
the
phenomenon
that
wa
titan
and
real
fan
would
have
to
look
as
far
back
as
1991
s
termin
2
for
their
last
proper
dose
of
hi
incred
epic
action
true
lie
while
fun
realli
doesn
t
count
so
the
anticip
for
avatar
ha
long
sinc
reach
fever
pitch
and
beyond
thank
for
the
patient
mass
avatar
ha
turn
out
to
be
the
biggest
and
best
event
movi
of
the
year
perhap
the
decad
the
stori
is
pure
cameron
simplic

a
parapleg
ex
marin
is
given
a
chanc
to
walk
again
through
the
use
of
a
uniqu
alien
bodi
call
an
avatar
it
is
hi
job
to
gain
the
trust
of
the
nativ
so
that
a
greedi
corpor
can
steal
the
preciou
metal
from
their
lush
moon
jake
s
sam
worthington
crippl
main
charact
is
the
perfect
point
of
contact
for
the
audienc

not
onli
is
he
new
to
the
visual
delight
of
pandora
but
hi
disabl
mean
that
everi
moment
in
hi
avatar
bodi
is
one
of
gloriou
freedom
from
the
confin
of
hi
chair
when
the
corpor
intent
becom
more
sinist
jake
must
choos
between
hi
new
found
place
with
the
nativ
and
hi
own
race
and
fight
for
what
he
believ
in
avatar
combin
part
of
pocahonta
and
braveheart
with
a
liber
dose
of
space
marin
into
an
epic
whole
that
take
nearli
three
full
hour
to
unfold
we
could
criticis
that
length
the
weak
stori
and
the
hammi
dialogu
we
could
attack
it
thinli
veil
ecolog
messag
or
the
frankli
bizarr
spiritu
in
it
second
half
but
honestli
noth
can
spoil
the
experi
while
you
are
envelop
in
it
and
a
larg
part
of
that
is
down
to
the
brilliant
use
of
3d

which
is
both
subtl
and
incred
effect
til
now
we
have
been
make
movi
with
3d
element
avatar
is
the
first
truli
3d
film
and
might
well
prove
to
be
one
of
the
most
signific
thing
to
happen
to
blockbust
film
make
sinc
star
war
cameron
is
also
push
the
envelop
with
truli
photo
real
cg

someth
which
ha
been
promis
for
year
but
ha
final
been
deliv
with
avatar
the
interact
of
the
charact
with
the
environ
is
incred
and
the
detail
on
the
face
of
the
motion
captur
lead
worthington
and
star
trek
s
zoe
saldana
bring
them
to
life
you
will
believ
total
in
their
perform
repres
anoth
quantum
leap
in
tool
which
have
rare
been
use
for
anyth
other
than
spectacl
make
no
mistak
avatar
is
an
import
film
from
a
technic
standpoint
but
it
is
also
great
entertain
the
world
of
pandora
is
a
stun
spectacl
from
scene
to
scene
and
as
jake
learn
more
about
the
na
vi
the
film
approach
the
kind
of
light
heart
adventur
stori
which
ha
been
absent
from
movi
theatr
for
year
then
the
final
act
explod
into
tragedi
and
desper
action
with
the
final
half
hour
a
blister
life
or
death
struggl
that
ha
to
be
seen
to
be
disbeliev
over
the
come
day
you
will
be
hear
a
lot
about
avatar
and
some
of
the
critic
reaction
is
bound
to
focu
on
it
weak
in
a
bid
to
appear
appropri
reserv
and
object
but
thi
is
not
a
film
to
be
dissect
or
examin
rather
one
to
be
experienc
with
a
warm
crowd
a
great
sound
system
in
