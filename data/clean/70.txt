for

himmler
had
had
at

one

in

noth

it

149
the
british
historian
sir
ian
kershaw
ha
argu
that
there
are
two
approach
to
the
widerstand
question
one
of
which
he
call
the
fundamentalist
deal
with
those
commit
to
overthrow
the
nazi
regim
and
the
societ
deal
with
form
of
dissent
in
everyday
life
150
in
kershaw
s
viewpoint
the
resistenz
concept
work
well
in
an
alltagsgeschicht
approach
but
work
less
well
in
the
field
of
high
polit
and
moreov
by
focus
onli
on
the
effect
of
one
s
action
fail
to
consid
the
crucial
element
of
the
intent
behind
one
s
action
151
kershaw
ha
argu
that
the
term
widerstand
should
be
use
onli
for
those
work
for
the
total
overthrow
of
the
nazi
system
and
those
engag
in
behavior
which
wa
counter
to
the
regim
s
wish
without
seek
to
overthrow
the
regim
should
be
includ
under
the
term
opposit
and
dissent
depend
upon
their
motiv
and
action
152
kershaw
ha
use
the
edelweiss
pirat
as
an
exampl
of
whose
behavior
initi
fell
under
dissent
and
who
advanc
from
there
to
opposit
and
final
to
resist
153
similarli
the
american
historian
claudia
koonz
in
her
1992
articl
ethic
dilemma
and
nazi
eugen
”
argu
that
those
who
protest
against
the
action
t4
program
usual
for
religi
reason
while
remain
silent
about
the
holocaust
cannot
be
consid
as
part
of
ani
resist
to
the
nazi
and
these
protest
can
onli
be
consid
as
a
form
of
dissent
154
in
kershaw
s
opinion
there
were
three
band
rang
from
dissent
to
opposit
to
resist
155
in
kershaw
s
view
there
wa
much
dissent
and
opposit
within
german
societi
but
outsid
of
the
work
class
veri
littl
resist
156
though
kershaw
ha
argu
that
the
resistenz
concept
ha
much
merit
overal
he
conclud
that
the
nazi
regim
had
a
broad
basi
of
support
and
consensu
and
it
is
correct
to
speak
of
resist
without
the

the
british
historian
sir
ian
kershaw
ha
argu
that
there
are
two
approach
to
the
widerstand
question
one
of
which
he
call
the
fundamentalist
deal
with
those
commit
to

the
nazi
regim
and
the
societ
deal
with
form
of
dissent
in

life
150
in
kershaw
s
viewpoint
the
resistenz
concept
work
well
in
an
alltagsgeschicht
approach
but
work
less
well
in
the
field
of
high
polit
and
moreov
by
focus
onli
on
the

of
one
s
action
fail
to
consid
the
crucial
element
of
the
intent
behind
one
s
action
151
kershaw
ha
argu
that
the
term
widerstand
should
be
use
onli
for
those
work
for
the
total
overthrow
of
the
nazi
system
and
those
engag

which
wa

152
kershaw
ha
use
the

as
an

of
whose
behavior
initi
fell
under

and
who
advanc
from
there
to

153
similarli
the
american
historian
claudia
koonz
in
her

”
argu
that
those
who
protest
against
the
action
t4
program
usual
for
religi
reason
while
remain
silent
about
the
holocaust
cannot
be
consid
as
part
of
ani
resist
to
the
nazi
and
these
protest
can
onli
be
consid
as
a
form
of
dissent
154
in
kershaw
s
opinion
there
were
three
band
rang
from
dissent
to
opposit
to
resist
155
in
kershaw
s
view
there
wa
much
dissent
and
opposit
within

outsid
of

156
though
kershaw
ha
argu
that
the
resistenz
concept
ha
much
merit
overal
he
conclud
that
the
nazi
regim
had
a
broad
basi
of
support
and
consensu
and
it
is
correct
to
speak
of

understand
that

is
not
the
free

the

what
we

the

they
rais
some

that

the
