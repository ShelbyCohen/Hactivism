we
didn

i
had

we
move
a

it
be

if
the
school
had
all
the
money
they
need
and
the
air
forc
had
to
hold
a
bake
sale
to
buy
a
bomber
thi
gave
us
the
idea
to
buy
use
militari
uniform
at
the
central
squar
armi
surplu
store
so
we
dress
as
gener
and
prop
the
poster
up
next
to
our
bake
good
and
told
peopl
we
need
then
to
purchas
our
cooki

so
we
could
buy
a

thi
caught
peopl
s
attent
and

didn
t
rais
much

we
did
reach
a

more
peopl
the

ask

to
design
a

also
sat
on
the

we
were
alreadi
distribut
produc
that
couldn
t
be

so
we
decid
to
take

prepar

dress
as

and
set
up
a

whi
do
you
think
food

ha
becom
so
wide
popular
food

reason
one
reason
is
that

simpl
way
for
peopl
to
get
involv
by
publish
the
seven
step
to
start
a
food
not

group
other
reason
are
that
each
group
is
independ
we
have
no
leader
and
an
agreement
that
the
food
is
alway
vegan
and
vegetarian
and
free
to
anyon
without
restrict
and
we
are
dedic
to
nonviol

with
their
friend
and
classmat
–
it
doe
not
reli
on
a
famou
person
or
leader
food
not

is
also
a
simpl
concept
and
becaus
we
have
no
paid
staff
or
director
and
the
food
is
recov
local
group
do
not
need
to
rais
huge
amount
of

to
oper
final
the
idea
that
you
can
be
part
of
a
global
network
seek
to
chang
societi
for
the
better
and
can
use
your

are
the
fact
that
mani

that
you

are
worri
that

our

that

–
a
threat
to

they
also
worri
that
our
share
of

with
the

show
that
we
can

they
fear
that
the
