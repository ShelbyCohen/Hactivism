the

no

and
attempt
to
ensur
that
most
of
it
food
is
organ
mchenri
explain
for
one
we
want
to
show
our
stanc
of
nonviol
against
anim
that
nonviol
mean
more
than
not
fight
war
the
other
reason
is
ecolog
vegetarian
food
and
vegan
food
in
particular
use
much
fewer
resourc
in
term
of
water
land
and
so
on
also
he
point
out
thi
is
mainli
a
poor
peopl
s
movement
and
we
want
the
food
not

model
to
spread
without
need
a
lot
of
money
with
vegan
food
you
don
t
need
a
steam
tabl
or
refriger
to
the
same
extent
you
do
for
meat
and
dairi
so
it
s
less
like
that
anybodi
will
get
ill
while
a
portion
of
the
food
serv
is
donat
mainli
the
rice
and
bean
that
are
a
mainstay
of
fnb
meal
a
good
deal
of
the
food
is
as
mchenri
say
recov
one
of
our
goal
he
say
is
to
keep
food
out
of
landfil
to
make
sure
that
the
energi
expend
to
grow
and
prepar
food
get
use
rather

when
it
s
be
discard
for
fear
of
spoilag
it
may
sound
dubiou
to
some
but
mchenri
is
quick
to
point
out
that
there
hasn
t
been
a
singl
known
case
of
sick
from
a
food
not

meal
with
a
histori

in

end
one

who

on

began
search
for

for

to

some
of
the

of

and
sever
younger
student
activist
began
recruit
their

to
come

moral
boost
we
began
to
figur
out
how
we
could

each
week
but
everi
time
the
system
fell
apart
after
a
coupl
of
month
coordin
would
pass
on
their
respons
to

or
would
take
on
all
the

themselv
and
not
look
for

learn
the
skill
that

no
