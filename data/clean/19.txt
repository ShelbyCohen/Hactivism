hello
brother
primarili
i
meant
theolog
connect
rather
than
histor
i
know
thay
it
is
disput
wether
how
much
baptism
wa
influenc
by
and
root
in
anabapt
but
sure
enough
they
share
the
same
theolog
of
baptism
as
well
as
the
relat
between
church
and
state
etc
so
doe
pentecost
while
some
want
to
trace
that
movement
back
to
holi
group
and
method
we
must
rememb
that
99
of
pentecost
practic
baptist
baptism
and
in
fact
sinc
the
earli
pentecost
were
pacifist

–
they
were

more
anabaptist
than
they
realiz
thi
is

i
’
d
like
to
call
anabapt
the

of

not
mother
not

i
don

too
much
about
the
histori
of
the
pentecost

but
i
find
it
strang
to
hear
that
pentecost
are
just
now
get
more
into
social
justic
issu
i
’
m
realli
not
sure
that
is
an
accur
claim
due
to
their
divers
and
azusa
street
spring
up
from
the
poor
margin
it
is
the
larg
pentecost
church
here
in
lo
angel
that
have
been
work
for
decad
to
help
their
member
climb
out
of
poverti
thi
is
in
addit
to
their
mani
missionari
effort
oversea
also
i
find
it
a
bit
strang
to
call
them
“
progress
pentecost
”
as
that
impli
they
got
their
social
conscienc
from
the
liber
progress
stream
of
christian
wherea
i
would
think
that
came
more
from
pentecost
’
root
in
the
holi
movement
it
may
be
that
pentecost
are
now
turn
more
of
their
vision
to
the
domest
sphere
rather
than
focus
primarili
on
oversea
work
there
is
some
good
info

about
the
20th

histori
of
the
3
wave
of

start
with
the
pentecost
of
azusa
street
then
move
on
to
the
charismat
in
the
mainlin
church
catholic
and
then
lastli
with
3rd
wave
group
like
the
vineyard
interestingli
nathan
distinguish
the
earli
pentecost
as
a
separ
movement
from
evangel
and
say
onli
later
have
they
start
to
merg
with
the
evangel

of
christian
realli
i
think
it
may
be
more
the

who
are

that

as

also
and
have
been
do
so
for
a
long

i
don

t
want
to
downplay
that
by
ani
mean
it
show
that
the
spirit
bring
both
gift
and
a
heart
for
the
poor
rather
what
i
adress
abov
is
the
lack
of
pacif
and
econom
equal
and
preval
of
violent
zionism
and
prosper
theolog
within

thi
is
someth
i

i
agre
with

that
the

it

the

and
while
they
do
state

can

often

conserv
they
still
describ

we
have
now
enter
the
holi
week
the
last
step
of
lent
in
which
the
liturg
year
rememb
the
passion
that
is
suffer
of
jesu
in
my
experi
it
is
not
so
common
among
pentecost
and
charismat
to
talk
about
suffer
as
someth
achiev
rather
our
emphasi
on
heal
ha
often
made
us
think
that
pain
is
alway
evil
and
while
i
am
convinc
that
we
should
alway
pray
and
work
to
allevi
involuntarili
suffer
we
should
also
be
readi
to
suffer
for
christ
’
s
sake
–
and
even
count
it
as
a
joy
mt

after
all
we
follow
a
crucifi
god
who
told
us
to
take
up
our
cross
and
follow
him
lk

he
told
us
that
we
should
expect
persecut
and
turn
the
other
cheek
when
attack
mt

we
are
also
told
in
the
scriptur
that
we
will
experi

thi
may
seem
hard
to
sync

kingdom
messag
of
fight
suffer
through
heal
deliver
poverti
reduct
and
peacemak
but
it
is
one
of
the
kingdom
paradox
–
while
we
should
allevi
suffer
we
should
be
readi
to
suffer
we
should
not
seek
suffer
or
be
happi
when
other
suffer
but
when
we
are
affect
by
suffer
which
undoubtedli
will
happen
from
time
to
time
we
should
not
interpret
it
as
be
abandon
by
god
but
see
it
as
a
humili
experi

us
to
identifi
