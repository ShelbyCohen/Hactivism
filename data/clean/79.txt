one
of
the
thing
i

when

whi
he

on
imag
and
sound
215
in

time
magazin
interview
in

kubrick
further
state
the
essenc

is
to
let

that
it

better
to

rather
than
write
an
origin
screenplay
and
that
you
should
choos
a
work
that
isn

you
can
improv
on
it
which
is
what
he

230
kubrick
told
robert

i
think
you
have
to
view
the
entir
problem
of
put
the

you
want

on

squar

the

it
s

i

is

the

firmli
believ
that

they
tri
238
when
you
make

it
take
a
few
day
just

them
the

of
even
one
other

is
discord
and
tend

produc
self
conscious
in

239
he
also
told
biograph
michel

invari
becaus
the

onli
well
enough
to
say

he
will
alway
have

soon
as
he
ha
to
work
on
the
emot
of
the
scene
or
find
camera
mark
in
a
strong
emot
scene
it
is
alway
best
to
be
abl
to
shoot
in
complet
take
to
allow
the
actor
a
continu
of
emot
and
it
is
rare
for
most
actor
to
reach
their
peak
more
than
onc
or
twice
there
are
