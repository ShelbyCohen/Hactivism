a

share
her
mere
mention
of
vegan
in
an
interview
about
her
2017
world

jojo
herself
start
that
same
interview
by
mention
her
interest
in
a

diet
and
the
posit
effect
remov
dairi
had
on
her
vocal

and

but
it
’
s
reveal
that
jojo
ha
a

ha
read
russel

“

ha
tweet
about

scone
befor
and
ha
a
strong
enough
internet
connect
to

the

and

but
we
know
“

in
the

of

doesn
’
t
make

a

can
you
imagin
our

if
it

didn

includ
her
“

bullshit
even
if
they
kept
“

in

clickbait
so
when
that

headlin
is
at
the
top
of
the
‘

googl

just
a
littl
more
confus
get
sprinkl
over
an
alreadi
confus
“

”
that
almost
pervers
cling
to
the
hope
a
teen
idol
will
be
the
key
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
not
the
clear
educ
and
understand
of

or
the
need
for
freedom
from

that

not

and
you

of

wa
smush

the
