–
but
pay
less

it
wa
a
shock
to
hear
him
get
back
to
where
he
onc
belong
on
song
from

–
for
the
first
time
in

year
he
decid
to
make
a
bona

it
wa
worth
wait
for
–
he

regain
their
hunger
as
a

team
with

certainli
back
further
listeningtumblewe
connect
1970
elton
and
berni
were
obsess
with
the
band
–
that
wa
practic
a
requir
for
english
rock
star
in
1970
they
tri
to
make
their
own
version
of
music
from
big

with
tumblewe
connect
a
wild
west
fantasi
that
onli
could
have

up
by

who
d
never

elton
even

1971
part
of
the
magic
of
ballad
like
levon
and
tini
dancer
is
the
actual
piano
elton
wa
play
–
the
legendari
bechstein
grand
at
london
s
trident
studio
it
s
the
most
famou
piano
in
rock
histori
–
the

realli
flatter
elton

here
as
he
and

what
is
levon
about
elton
ha
no

part
of
the
enjoy
and
mystiqu
of
our
thing
is
we
ve
never

i
d
never
ask
berni
what
it
mean
for

–
on

he
s
a

he
quickli
becam
it

yet
the

is
so
convinc
it
might
have
help
inspir
the

on

two
of
exil
on

street
don

shoot
me
i
m
onli
the
piano
player
1973
as
elton
said
at
the
time
i
alway
think
of
it
as
elton
john
s
dispos
album
he
meant
that
as
a
compliment
–
don

shoot
me
is
pure
razzl
dazzl
or
as
he
put
it
a
veri
happi
album
veri
ultra
pop
he
score
hi
first
number
one
with
the
sock
hop
romp
crocodil
rock
but
got
sentiment
with
tearjerk
like
high

daniel
a
tale
of

love
wa
use
memor
by
martin

in
a

radio
scene
from
alic
doesn

anymor
elton
shudder
at
the
idea
of
anyon
take
it
serious
i
wouldn
t
like
in
15
year
time
to
be
still
play
crocodil
rock
but
as
he
ha
spent
hi
career
prove
dispos
can
also
be
classic
rock
of
the
westi
1975
elton
wa
coast
on
sheer
adrenalin
at
thi
point
rock
harder
than
ever
–
although
call
one
of
these
song
street
kid
might
have
been
push
it
a
lot
of
critic
said
it
didn
t
have
much
depth
to
it
and
probabl
it
doesn
t
have
much
depth
to
it
he
admit
back
then
but
who
need
depth
when
you
ve
got
island
girl
a

top
ode
to
a
six

three
sex
machin
who
will
wrap
her
leg
around
you
like
a
well
worn

there
s
onli
one
ballad
on
westi
yet
what
a
ballad
i
feel
like
a
bullet
in
the
gun
of
robert
ford
not
just
hi
best
western
but
a
breakup
lament
that
should
have
been
a
hit
hi
next
album
wa
a
crash
bummer
–
the
career
freez
mess
blue

–
so
westi
serv
as
a
farewel
to
the
first
golden

jump
up
1982
i
suppos
you
could
blame
it
on

well
put
berni
elton
s
new

album
is
hi
weirdest
ever
and
that
s
say
someth
–
tri
to
break
out
of

oh
dear
taupin
call
it
one
of
those
batch
of
album
when
we
were
realli
not
stellar
and
on
the
top
of
our
game
i
d
rather
not
think
back
on
some
of
that

sorri
berni
–
jump
up
stand
as
proof
these
two
could
write
great
tune
even
when
they
were
hit
rock
bottom
too
low
for
zero
1983
elton
came
back
strong
as
an
elder
statesman
with
too
low
for
zero
–
he
won
over
the
new
romant
kid
with
i
m
still
stand
a
pansexu
mtv
hit
where
he
frolic
on

with
a
fist
of
glitter
he
went
hair
metal
in
kiss
the
bride
and
croon
one
of
hi
finest
ballad
i
guess
that
s
whi
they
call
it
the
blue
roll
like
thunder
under
the
cover
to
a
stevi
wonder
harmonica
solo
after
too
low

elton
would
never
face
anoth
seriou
popular
drought
–
though
hi
creativ

would
wax
and
wane
the
one
the
one
1992
elton
s
first
post
rehab
album
set
him
up
as
a
nineti
rock
elder

readi
to
go

thing
about

–
he
s
a
fan
who

the
unlik
