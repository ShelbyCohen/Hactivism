to
us
a

seek
to
use
your
black

a
stamp
that
mark
you
out
as
a
subservi
be
from
the

therefor
we
can
see
that
the

black
is
not

all

i

the
fact
that
we
are
all
not

if

peopl
real
black
peopl
are
those
who
can
manag
to
hold
their
head
high
in
defianc
rather
than
willingli
surrend
their
soul
to
the
white

briefli
defin
therefor
black
conscious
is
in
essenc
the
realiz
by
the
black
man
of
the
need
to
ralli
togeth
with
hi
brother
around
the
caus
of
their
oppress
the
black
of
their
skin
and
to
oper
as
a
group
in
order
to
rid
themselv
of
the
shackl
that
bind
them
to
perpetu
servitud
it
seek
to
demonstr
the
lie
that
black
is
an
aberr
from
the
normal
which
is
white
it
is
a
manifest
of
a
new
realiz
that
by
seek
to
run
away
from
themselv
and
to
emul
the
white
man
black
are
insult
the
intellig
of
whoever
creat
them
black
black
conscious
therefor
take
cogniz
of
the
deliber
of
the
god
s
plan
in
creat
black
peopl
black
it
seek
to
infus
the
black
commun
with
a
new
found
pride
in
themselv
their
effort
their
valu
system
their
cultur
their
religion
and
their
outlook
to
life
the
interrelationship
between
the
conscious
of
the
self
and
the
emancipatori
programm
is
of
a
paramount
import
black
no
longer
seek
to
reform
the
system
becaus
so
do
impli
accept
of
the
major
point
around
which
the
system
revolv
black
are
out
to
complet
transform
the
system
and
to
make
of
it
what
they
wish
such
a
major
undertak
can
onli
be
realiz
in
an
atmospher
where
peopl
are
convinc
of
the
truth
inher
in
their
stand
liber
therefor
is
of
paramount
import
in
the
concept
of
black
conscious
for
we
cannot
be
consciou
of
ourselv
and
yet
remain
in
bondag
we
want
to
attain
the
envis
self
which
is
a
free
self
the
surg
toward
black
conscious
is
a
phenomenon
that
ha
manifest
itself
throughout
the
so
call
third
world
there
is
no
doubt
that
discrimin
against
the
black
man
the
word
over
fetch
it
origin
from
the
exploit
attitud
of
the
white
man
colon
of
white
countri
by
white
ha
throughout
histori
result
in
noth
more
than
sinist
than
mere
cultur
or
geograph
fusion
at
worst
or
languag
bastard
at
best
it
is
true
that
the
histori
of
weaker
nation
is
shape
by
bigger
nation
but
nowher
in
the
world
today
do
we
see
white
exploit
white
on
scale
even
remot
similar
to
what
is
happen
in
south
africa
henc
one
is
forc
to
conclud
that
it
is
not
coincid
that
black
peopl
are
exploit
it
wa
a
deliber
plan
which
ha
culmin
in
even
so
call
black
independ
countri
not
attain
ani
real
independ
with
thi
background
in
mind
we
are
forc
therefor
to
believ
that
it
is
a
case
of
have
against
have
not
where
white
have
been
deliber
made
have
and
black
have
not
there
is
for
instanc
no
worker
in
the
classic
sens
among
white
in
south
africa
for
even
the
most
downtrodden
white
worker
still
ha
a
lot
lose
if
the
system
is
chang
he
is
protect
by
sever
law
against
competit
at
work
from
the
major
he
ha
a
vote
and
he
use
it
to
return
the
nationalist
govern
to
power
becaus
he
see
them
as
the
onli
peopl
who
through
job
reserv
law
are
bent
on
look
after
hi
interest
against
competit
with
the
nativ
it
should
therefor
be
accept
that
analysi
of
our
situat
in
term
of
one
s
colour
at
onc
take
care
of
the
greatest
singl
determin
for
polit
action
i
e
colour
while
also
validli
describ
the
black
as
the
onli
real
worker
in
south
africa
it
immedi
kill
all
suggest
that
there
could
ever
be
effect
rapport
between
the
real
worker
i
e
black
and
the
privileg
white
worker
sinc
we
have
shown
that
the
latter
are
the
greatest
support
of
the
system
true
enough
the
system
ha
allow
so
danger
an
anti
black
attitud
to
build
up
amongst
white
who
are
econom
nearest
to
the
black
demonstr
the
distanc
between
themselv
and
the
black
by
an
exagger
reactionari
attitud
toward
black
henc
the
greatest
anti
black
feel
is
to
be
found
amongst
the
veri
poor
white
whom
the
class
theori
call
upon
to
be
with
black
worker
in
the
struggl
for
emancip
thi
is
the
kind
of
twist
logic
that
black
conscious
approach
seek
to
erad
in
term
of
the
black
conscious
approach
we
recogn
the
exist
of
one
major
forc
in
south
africa
thi
is
white
racism
it
is
the
one
forc
against
which
all
of
us
are
pit
it
work
with
unnerv
total
featur
both
on
the
offens
and
in
our
defenc
it
greatest
alli
to
date
ha
been
the
refus
by
us
to
progress
lose
ourselv
in
a
world
of
colourless
and
amorph
common
human
white
are
deriv
pleasur
and
secur
in
entrench
white
racism
and
further
exploit
the
mind
and
bodi
of
the
unsuspect
black
mass
their
agent
are
ever
present
amongst
us
tell
that
it
is
immor
to
withdraw
into
a
cocoon
that
dialogu
is
the
answer
to
our
problem
and
that
it
is
unfortun
that
there
is
white
racism
in
some
quarter
but
you
must
that
thing
are
chang
these
in
fact
are
the
greatest
racist
for
they
refus
to
credit
us
ani
intellig
to
know
what
we
want
their
intent
are
obviou
they
want
to
be
baromet
by
which
the
rest
of
the
white
societi
can
measur
feel
in
the
black
world
thi
then
is
what
make
us
believ
that
white
power
present
itself
as
a
total
not
onli
provok
us
but
also
control
our
respons
to
the
provoc
thi
is
an
import
point
to
note
becaus
it
is
often
miss
by
those
who
believ
that
there
are
a
few
good
white
sure
there
are
few
good
white
just
as
much
as
there
are
a
few
bad
black
howev
what
we
are
concern
here
with
is
group
attitud
and
group
polit
the
except
doe
not
make
a
lie
of
a
rule
it
mere
substanti
it
the
overal
analysi
therefor
base
on
the
hegelian
theori
of
dialect
materi
is
as
follow
that
sinc
the
thesi
is
a
white
racism
there
can
onli
be
one
valid
antithesi
i
e
a
solid
black
uniti
to
counterbal
the
scale
if
south
africa
is
to
be
a
land
where
black
and
white
live
togeth
in
harmoni
without
fear
of
group
exploit
it
is
onli
when
these
two
opposit
have
interplay
and
produc
a
viabl
synthesi
of
idea
and
modu
vivendi
we
can
never
wage
ani
struggl
without
offer
a
strong
counterpoint
to
the
white
racism
that
permeat
our
societi
so
effect
one
must
immedi
dispel
the
thought
that
black
conscious
is
mere
a
methodolog
or
a
mean
toward
an
end
what
black
conscious
seek
to
do
is
to
produc
at
the
output
end
of
the
process
real
black
peopl
who
do
not
regard
themselv
as
the
appendag
to
white
societi
thi
truth
cannot
be
reserv
we
do
not
need
to
apolog
for
thi
becaus
it
is
true
that
the
white
system
have
produc
throughout
the
world
a
number
of
peopl
who
are
not
awar
that
they
too
are
peopl
our
adher
to
valu
that
we
set
for
ourselv
can
also
not
be
revers
becaus
it
will
alway
be
a
lie
to
accept
white
valu
as
necessarili
the
best
the
fact
that
a
synthesi
may
be
attain
onli
relat
to
adher
to
power
polit
someon
somewher
along
the
line
will
be
forc
to
accept
the
truth
and
here
we
believ
that
our
is
the
truth
the
futur
of
south
africa
in
the
case
where
black
adopt
black
conscious
is
the
subject
for
concern
especi
among
initi
what
do
we
do
when
have
attain
our
conscious
do
we
propos
to
kick
white
out
i
believ
person
that
the
answer
to
these
question
ought
to
be
found
in
the
saso
polici
manifesto
and
in
our
analysi
of
the
situat
in
south
africa
we
have
defin
what
we
mean
by
true
integr
and
the
veri
fact
that
such
a
definit
exist
doe
illustr
what
our
standpoint
is
in
ani
case
we
are
much
more
concern
about
what
is
happen
now
than
will
happen
in
the
futur
the
futur
will
alway
be
shape
by
the
sequenc
of
present
day
event
the
import
of
black
solidar
to
the
variou
segment
of
the
black
commun
must
not
be
underst
there
have
been
in
the
past
a
lot
of
suggest
that
there
can
be
no
viabl
uniti
amongst
black
becaus
they
hold
each
other
in
contempt
colour
despis
african
becaus
they
the
former
by
their
proxim
to
the
african
may
lose
the
chanc
of
assimil
into
the
white
world
african
despis
the
colour
and
indian
for
a
varieti
of
reason
indian
not
onli
despis
african
but
in
mani
instanc
also
exploit
the
african
in
job
and
shop
situat
all
these
stereotyp
attitud
have
led
to
mountain
inter
group
suspicion
amongst
the
black
what
we
should
at
all
time
look
at
is
the
fact
that
we
are
all
oppress
by
the
same
system
that
we
are
oppress
to
vari
degre
is
a
deliber
design
to
stratifi
us
not
onli
social
but
also
in
term
of
the
enemi
s
aspir
therefor
it
is
to
be
expect
that
in
term
of
the
enemi
s
plan
there
must
be
thi
suspicion
and
that
if
we
are
commit
to
the
problem
of
emancip
to
the
same
degre
it
is
part
of
our
duti
to
bring
to
the
black
peopl
the
deliber
of
the
enemi
s
subjug
scheme
that
we
should
go
on
with
our
programm
attract
to
it
onli
commit
peopl
and
not
just
those
eager
to
see
an
equit
distribut
of
group
amongst
our
rank
thi
is
a
game
common
amongst
liber
the
one
criterion
that
must
govern
all
our
action
is
commit
further
implic
of
black
conscious
are
to
do
with
correct
fals
imag
of
ourselv
in
term
of
cultur
educ
religion
econom
the
import
of
thi
also
must
not
be
underst
there
is
alway
an
interplay
between
the
histori
of
peopl
i
e
the
past
their
faith
in
themselv
and
hope
for
their
futur
we
are
awar
of
the
terribl
role
play
by
our
educ
and
religion
in
creat
amongst
us
a
fals
understand
of
ourselv
we
must
therefor
work
out
scheme
not
onli
to
correct
thi
but
further
to
be
our
own
author
rather
than
wait
to
be
interpret
by
other
white
can
onli
see
us
from
the
outsid
and
as
such
can
never
extract
and
analyz
the
etho
in
the
black
commun
in
summari
therefor
one
need
onli
refer
thi
hous
to
the
saso
polici
manifesto
which
carri
most
of
the
salient
point
in
the
definit
of
the
black
conscious
i
wish
to
stress
again
the
need
for
us
to
know
veri
clearli
what
we
mean
by
certain
term
and
what
our
understand
is
when
we
talk
of

born
from

it

“

write
in
an

in

describ

reinvigor

at

john

write
after

observ
that
“

is
that

alway
center
the

v
with
thi
understand
it
is
therefor
no

whi
black

would
reject
