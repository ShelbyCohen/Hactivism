not
the

though
the
environment
movement
ha
long
use

to
advanc
it
aim
includ
the

the
basic
design
—
strateg
target
state
to
creat
momentum
for

chang
—
could
still
appli
the
first
lesson
other
campaign
could
learn
from
the
marriag
movement
solomon
told
me
is
use
state
and
local
polit
to
put
point
on

run
aground

when
there
appear
to
be

have
becom

campaign
won
a
referendum
in
washington
state
last
year
and
numer
state
and
citi
have
recent
hike
their

the
key
solomon
say
is
to
ruthlessli
pick
the
right

base
on
care

and
a
tough
mind
willing
to
say
“
