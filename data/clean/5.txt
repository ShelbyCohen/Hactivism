and
make
it
veri
clear
how
your

may
be
rob
you
of

freedom
you
should
now
be
awar
that
it
is
possibl
to

on

but
don

wast
all
those

you

invest

instead
the
abov
spreadsheet
wa
a
fundament
tool
in
help
me
achiev
my
financi
goal
and
for
help
me
figur
out
when
i
can
consid
myself
retir
think
you
ve
got
a
feel
for
compound
interest
now
ok
tri
guess
thi
if
i
start
with
r1
today
and
doubl
it
everi
day
for
40
day
how
much
would
i
have
inflat
erod
your
wealth
over
time
in
just
as
big
a
way
and
is
typic
higher
than
quot
by
the
govern
as
that
is
base
on
bare
necess
but
your
inflat
is
base
on
thing
like
car
hous
school
univers
fee
etc
inflat
is
typic
higher
than
the
best
rate
a
bank
will
give
you
on
a
save
invest
account
i
like
to
think
that
it
is
around
12
so
you
need
to
earn
more
than
that
to
beat
inflat
otherwis
you
are
get
poorer
the
best
way
to
beat
inflat
as
proven
over
time
is
to
invest
in
share
aka
stock
unit
trust
aka
mutual
fund
and
or
properti
you
could
of
cours
start
your
own
busi
too
my
prefer
is
share
good
return
without
requir
much
of
my
time
surprisingli
share
are
also
less
riski
becaus
of
a
thing
call
stop
loss
which
none
of
the
other
option
have
you
should
learn
to
invest
your
money
i
e
buy
incom
gener
asset
an
easi
way
to
start
right
now
assum
your
debt
are
paid
off
is
to
invest
in
satrix
40
tax
free
with
thi
a
comput
not
an

human
take
your

and
invest
it
