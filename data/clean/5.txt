the
paragraph
about
the
theme
that
sacrific
is
necessari
is
written
like
the
writer
believ
the
violenc
of
the
french
revolut
like
the
guillotin
wa
necessari
but
to
me
it
seem
like
dicken
wa
clearli
condemn
the
violenc
if
not
the
revolut
itself
it
also
use
what
mr
defarg
said
to
her
husband
but
she
s
a
villain
in
the
stori
and
i
don
t
think
we
should
be
