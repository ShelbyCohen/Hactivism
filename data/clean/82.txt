mani
of
us
are
out
there
awaken
to
their
psychiatr

wow
my
heart
feel
so
full
right
now
so
full
i
just
got
back
from
meet
up
with
someon
i
wa
on
a
psych
ward
with
a
number
of
year
ago
it
wa
their
first
encount
with
psychiatri
by
that
time
i
wa
well
establish
in
my
mental
patient
career
we
didn
’
t
stay
in
touch
as
we
went
our
separ
way
and
they
’
d
continu
on
the
mental
patient
path
for
a
number
of
year
to
follow
…
until
they
began
to
wake
up
i
ask
them
how
it
happen
and
thi
is
what
they
said
they
didn
’
t
find
a
book
or
a
person
or
a
websit
…
they
found
someth
insid
of
themself
that
told
them
“
all
of
thi
…
these
diagnos
thi
treatment
these
drug
they
aren
’
t
your
answer
”
so
they
began
to
come
off
the
pill
and
educ
themselv
onlin
about
withdraw
which
is
how
they
found
me
i
guess
they
recogn
my
face
in
daniel
mackler
’
s
film
‘
come
off
psych
drug
’
how
cool
they
track
me
down
on
facebook
and
reach
out
to
say
hi
and
we
met
up
just
a
coupl
hour
ago
we
launch
right
into
a
most
wonder
exchang
about
the
lie
we
were
sold
by
the
so
call
“
mental
health
system
”
the
way
the
drug
shut
us
down
and
disconnect
us
from
the
veri
begin
but
we
’
d
been
so
effect
trick
into
think
it
wa
our
“
treatment
resist
mental
ill
”
that
it
never
cross
our
mind
it
might
possibl
be
the
“
treatment
”
itself
they
’
ve
been
free
from
drug
for
two
month
now
and
though
they
’
re
feel
the
intens
of
withdraw
—
as
so
mani
of
us
do
—
they
’
re
aliv
and
awak
and
fire
up
about
chang
the
world
they
vibrat
with

forc
it
wa
beauti
we
talk
about
the
role

’
s
someth
wrong
with
us
as
individu
and
not

and
what
amaz
me
the
most
is
that
my

last

i
sat
at

from

i
saw
over
my
fourteen
year
as
a

all
come
togeth
to
put
me
on
trial
for

for
as

who
aren

who
are
sit
on

for

freedom
and
bodili

under

”
as
i
write
these

and
i
thought
as
well
about
how
my
dream
is
perhap
not
that
far
from

for
mani
of

in

what

is
there

thi

as
i

there
’

one
thing
that
’

unquestion
to
me
no

ahead
may
be
for

isn

to
back
away
in

to
put
ourselv

the
solut
is
not

there
is
no

antipsychiatri

have
no
doubt
that
human

is
real
and
that

that
view
the

flaw
further
antipsychiatri
activist
believ
that
most
psychiatrist
do
consider
harm
addit
given
the
power
they
have
in

we
believ
that
interact
with

we
expect
the
