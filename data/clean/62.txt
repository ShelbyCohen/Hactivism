what
we

assum
is
that
the
best

to

is
for

we

behind
those
everyday
step
we
take
in

for

it
is
the
yet
to
be
feasibl
idea
it
is
the
bold
leap
of
heart
and
intellect
into

futur
it
is
our
stubborn
refus
to

the

where
human
be
may
dwell
without

or

without

a
horribl
price
for
what
they
are
and
who
they
love
our
answer
to
these
question
will
tell
us
much
about
the
substanc
of
our
vision
they
will
tell
us
whether
we
have
decid
to
put
up
a

fight
in
a
small
world
with
a
narrow
plan
design
to

a

or
whether
we
have
decid

build
