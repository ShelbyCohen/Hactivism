understood
that
he
s
an
icon
befor
i
start
studi
music
as
a
kid
when
i
start
play
guitar
i
wa
into

creat
it
s
imposs
i
ve
listen
to
a

guitar
solo
and
you
can
alway
pick
it
out
right
away
that
s
from
the
man
right
there
it
s
in
the
way
he
bend
string
but
also
hi
rhythm
play
is
someth
that
deserv
a
lot
of
shine
as
well
it
s
an
incred
thing
a
good
major
of
kid
whether
they
realiz
it
or
not
are
play
a
barr
chord
and
do
the
signatur
rock

thing
that
s
chuck

right
there
you
can
t
pick
up
a
guitar
and
not

someth
chuck

creat
anybodi
that
you
consid
to
be
a
rock

or
ani
well
known
rock
band
in

–
the
roll
stone
the
beatl
it

a
whole

i
think
he

simpli
put
if

not
been
chuck
berri
music
would
be
differ
i
got
the
chanc
to
open
up
a
show
for
him
when
i
wa
young
–
mayb
20
21
–
down
in
austin
i
guess
he
didn
t
bring
a
band
with
him
so
he
would
just
hire
band
on
the
road
he
hire
some
guy
that
i
know
thi
band
call
the
egg
men
which
is
a
beatl
cover
band
–
which
is
funni
think
about
it
now
think
about
the
influenc
of
chuck
laugh
–
so
he
hire
these
guy
and
said
we
re
just
go
to
play
chuck
berri
song
that
s
all
he
told
them
they
