leo
as
alway

the
onli
fault
thi

ha
is
it
lack
of

develop

which
i

dismiss

now
that
i

what
do
we
know
about
joseph
gordon
levitt
in
the

despit
him
walk
all
over

and
tom
hardi
s
smart
aleck
although
it
s
easi
to
get
lost
in
thi
adventur
director
nolan
doesn
t
expect
you
to
understand
everi
key
aspect
of
thi
film
instead
just
accept
the
fact
that
thi
is
a
complic
movi
but
one
whose
stori
is
handl
with
meticul
care
without
question
a
veri
good
film
and
one
that
is
deserv
of
