correct
in
that
we

it
underestim
how

on
the

hand
superior

have
becom
inextric

so
it
can
be
incred
difficult
and
perhap
even
imposs
to
entir
disentangl
our
emot
from

signal
that
’
s
not

say
that
it
cannot
be
done
but
we
need
to
address
the
context
in
which
we
live
in

bodi
befor
we
can
start
to
challeng
and
relearn
the
way
that
we
feed

view
our

is
mislead
although
i
absolut
110
agre
that
the
what
we
view
as
“
healthi
”
should
be
a
much
much
much
broader
rang
of
weight
it
is
undeni
that
there
are
certain
weight
at
which
you
just
cannot
be
healthi
at
you
cannot
be
a
healthi
adult
at
50lb
just
like
you
cannot
be
a
healthi
adult
at
500lb
and
so
the
name
of
the
movement
leav
it
open
to
critic
from
the
onset
prader
willi
syndrom
hypothyroid
cancer
depress
anxieti
or
eat
disord
are
a
few
exampl
which
can
caus
a
person
’
s
weight
to
plummet
or
skyrocket
and
there
are
weight
that
are
too
low
or
too
high
for
anyon
to
be
healthi
at
so
for
me
i
believ
in
health
at
pretti
much
everi
size
and
whilst
health
at
everi
size
is
much
more
catchi
it
’
s
technic
incorrect
allow
those
against
the
movement
an
easi
start
point
on
which
to
discredit
it
last
but
not
least
hae
aim
to
provid
peopl
with
the
inform
to
start
work
toward
accept
their
bodi
whatev
their
weight
shape
and
size
in
order
to
improv
both
physic
and
mental
health
howev
it
also
ha
to
be
address
that
we
live
in
a
societi
where
fat
peopl
are
constantli
subject
to
prejudic
bodi
shame
weight
stigma
and
discrimin
fat
peopl
who
agre
with
hae
may
still
struggl
to
accept
their
bodi
size
in
a
cultur
so
cruel
to
them
and
their
inabl
to
find
peac
with
their
bodi
may
well
becom
yet
anoth
sourc
of
shame
again
thi
isn
’
t
a
flaw
in
the
principl
of
hae
but
a
topic
that
may
need
more
recognit
so
what
is
the
differ
between
health
at
everi
size
and
the
fat
accept
movement
let
’
s
take
a
look
at
the
latter
the
fat
accept
movement
also
known
as
the
size
accept
fat
liber
fat
activ
fativ
or
fat
power
movement
is
a
social
movement
seek
to
chang
anti
fat
bia
in
social
attitud
those
involv
seek
to
chang
attitud
toward
fat
peopl
in
area
of
life
includ
the
aesthet
legal
and
medic
approach
to
peopl
whose
bodi
are
fatter
than
the
social
norm
the
fat
accept
movement
focus
more
on
the
way
fat
peopl
are
perceiv
and
judg
due
to
their
weight
shape
or
size
and
although
it
doe
address
physic
health
and
the
research
to
back
up
the
same
principl
as
the
health
at
everi
size
movement
it
is
more
focus
around
chang
the
way
fat
peopl
are
treat
and
discrimin
against
fat
peopl
are
often
dehumanis
and
shown
far
less
respect
than
those
that
are
at
a
social
“
accept
”
weight
one
of
the
main
exampl
is
medic
care
fat
peopl
’
s
medic
issu
are
often
inaccur
dismiss
as
be
caus
by
their
weight
are
shown
less
respect
and
are
often
shame
for
their
bodi
size
the
big
is
beauti
movement
is
a
smaller
movement
that
come
under
the
fat
accept
movement
and
focus
more
on
aesthet
it
messag
is
that
peopl
whose
bodi
are
bigger
than
what
is
consid
social
“
accept
”
are
beauti
too
and
that
you
don
’
t
have
to
be
a
certain
weight
shape
or
size
to
be
attract
it
aim
is
to
help
peopl
find
beauti
in
their
bodi
regardless
of
ani
contribut
factor
that
make
them
look
a
certain
way
health
is
besid
the
point
both
movement
are
focus
around
respect
and
also
talk
about
health
as
irrelev
the
idea
is
that
even
if
you
believ
that
someon
is
unhealthi
due
to
their
weight
it
not
your
busi
what
lifestyl
choic
they
make
and
they
should
be
treat
with
respect
regardless
of
those
choic
for
exampl
we
all
know
peopl
who
smoke
or
bing
drink
but
we
do
not
treat
them
as
less
human
on
an
everyday
basi
becaus
those
choic
lead
to
poor
health
we
do
not
assum
their
person
or
directli
link
their
person
lifestyl
choic
with
their
moral
charact
thi
is
whi
these
movement
are
so
import
they
address
the
way
societi
perceiv
and
treat
peopl
who
are
fat
my
onli
critic
of
these
two
movement
fat
accept
and
big
is
beauti
is
that
there
are
some
peopl
involv
in
thi
movement
who
look
down
on
those
who
diet
as
betray
of
the
movement
when
they
should
be
seen
as
victim
of
a
diet
and
weight
loss
obsess
societi
as
i
state
abov
with
hae
it
can
be
forgotten
how
power

pervas
“

”
are
and
all
of
us
are
affect
by
it
in
some
way
even
if
we
do
constantli
work
to
disentangl
ourselv
from
it
and
rise
abov
it
we
should
all
be
work
togeth
to
support
one
anoth
and
help
to
lift
each
other
up
not

down
we

the

everi
size
hae
movement
ha
becom
a
popular
altern
to
the
domin
scientif
discours
on
obes
particularli
among
fat
activist
and
the
fat
accept
movement
as
well
as
some
nutritionist
eager
to
avoid
an
over
emphasi
on
bodi
weight
in
their
work
with
client
first
develop
by
american
psychotherapist
and
nutritionist
linda
bacon
2010
the
main
argument
of
hae
is
that
good
health
and
physic
fit
can
be
achiev
regardless
of
bodi
size
as
such
the
approach
agre
with
the
assert
made
by
mani
other
obes
sceptic
that
fat
doe
not
necessarili
caus
ill
health
and
prematur
mortal
and
that
lose
weight
may
not
improv
health
statu
see
here
for
my
previou
post
on
the
content
of
obes
sceptic
a
central
plank
of
the
hae
approach
is
that
weight
loss
by
mean
of
continu
diet
attempt
and
punish
exercis
regimen
should
not
be
the
main
goal
of
those
seek
to
live
a
healthier
life
instead
of
attempt
to
follow
the
rigid
guidelin
of
medic
advic
on
lose
weight
and
focus
exclus
on
thi
object
individu
should
instead
follow
their
bodi
’
intuit
lead
in
choos
their
diet
and
exercis
activ
they
should
learn
the
instinct
hunger
and
full
cue
of
their
bodi
and
eat
accordingli
whether
or
not
follow
these
cue
lead
to
weight
loss
for
exampl
in
an
inform
sheet
about

2008
bacon
note
that
‘
we
all
have
intern
system
design
to
keep
us
healthi
–
and
at
a
healthi
weight
support
your
bodi

natur
find
it
appropri
weight
by
honour
it
signal
of
hunger
full
and
appetit
’
in
a
youtub
video
she
claim
that
as
long
as
‘
you
stop
fight
yourself
achiev
and
maintain
the
weight
that
is
right
for
you
is
effortless
–
your
bodi
doe
the
job
for
you
’
a
further
integr
part
of
the
hae
philosophi
and
one
that
bespeak
bacon
’
s
other
train
as
a
psychotherapist
is
that
peopl
should
accept
their
bodi
’
size
and
weight
and
learn
to
love
themselv
the
‘
health
at
everi
size
promis
’
is
that
‘
you
can
feel
better
about
yourself
you
can
feel
love
accept
and
vital
–
and
you
can
improv
your
health

regardless
of
whether
you

emphasi

put
forward

all
seem
so
simpl
love
yourself
and
other
will
love
you
trust
your
bodi
’
s
instinct
and
good
health
will
follow
the
hae

appear
to
be
emin
laudabl
avoid
the
kind
of

yet
i
would
argu
that
there
are
element
of
the

should
be
held
up

it

to
challeng

the

that
ha
it

independ

where

gone
through

i
agre
with

support
the
major
principl

a

and
that
everyon
regardless
of
their
size
and
shape
should
seek
a
lifestyl
that
is
both
pleasur
and
healthi
as
a
sociologist
i
tend
to
approach
the
word
‘
natur
’
‘
instinct
’
or
‘
intern
cue
’
with
suspicion
from
a
sociolog
perspect
the
way
in
which
we
understand
view
repres
and
live
our
bodi
are
alway
site
within
cultur
and
social
context
the
bodi
is
view
as
a
complex
interplay
of
biolog
societi
and
cultur
in
which
it
is
extrem
difficult
to
extric
one
element
from
the
other
i
also
find
the
continu
posit
of
‘
your
bodi
’
as
a
separ
entiti
from
‘
you
’
in
hae
discours
problemat
thi
discours
reproduc
the
classic
cartesian
dualiti
of
the
mind
self
as
separ
from
the
bodi
flesh
and
turn
it
on
it
head
instead
of
the
ration
mind
posit
as
superior
to
the
fleshli
bodi
here
the
bodi
is
repres
as
‘
wise
’
and
all
know
to
which
the
mind
self

of

how
to

from

me
as
a

also
been
aim

chang
the
structur
problem
of

psycholog
practic
use
weight
as

for

in
that

is
not
just
an

it
is
meant

the

about

even

that

that
is
becaus
of
the
connect

the

big
popular
self

version
of
“

”
the
intuit
eat
thread
wa
alway
problemat
due
in
part
to
the
assumpt
that
weight

would
follow
but
in
the
debat
between
“
listen

”
vs
“
you
have
the
wisdom
about

full

i
still
find
the

more
reliabl

with

thi
is
a
great
post
and
a
pleasur
to
read
i
particularli
like
the
identif
of
the
cartesian
dualism
mistak
i
like
wittgenstein
’
s
treatment
of
thi
error
with
regard
to
person
subject
experi
of
pain
i
believ
that
it
is
these
kind
of
error
that
lead
to
these
philosoph
and
consequenti
social
issu
that
you
discuss
in
thi
case
i
think
it
come
from
the
way
we
believ
that
‘
you
’
stand
in
relat
to
‘
your
feel
’
when
a
fat
person
say
‘
i
am
in
pain
’
he
is
not
say
thi
fat
person
is
in
pain
he
is
not
make
a
statement
about
a
person
but
in
believ
so
we
come
to
a
dualist
point
of
view
which
may
lead
us
to
believ
we
can
chang
one
without
the
other
in
the
same
way
we
believ
we
can
chang
‘
your
’
bodi
size
without
affect
‘
you
’
and
so
we
can
also
do
the
opposit
you
quot
bacon
as
say
‘
give
you
tool
…
to
live
in
a

’
thi
is
exactli
that
error
i
don

–
i
can

what
my
‘

t
‘

what
it

‘

’
is
no
more
a
statement
about
someon
that

also
