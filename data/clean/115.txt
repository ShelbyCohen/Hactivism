expect
a
truli
great
action
set
piec
the
pod
race
one
of
the
best
action
set
piec
in
the
entir
seri
and
he
gave
them
a
lightsab
duel
unlik
ani
they
d
ever
seen
but
that
wasn
t
enough
sadli
had
luca
made
a
film
that
wa
littl
more
than
a
remak
of
star
war
with
anakin
in
the
luke
role
fan
would
have
been
happi
and
i
think
that
say
more
about
the
limit
scope
of
star
war
fan
than
it
doe
about
the
talent
of
georg
luca
the
phantom
menac
like
all
the
film
in
the
seri
ha
it
s
own
uniqu
tone
and
flavor
and
though
these
flavor
may
not
be
to
everyon
s
tast
i
think
in
the
come
year
more
and
more
fan
will
come
to
appreci
thi
film
for
what
it
is
rather
than
what
they
wish
it
would
be

–
see
all
my
review
if
you
listen
to
some
fan
of
the
origin
star
war
trilog
the
new
one
is
crap
thi
is
i
ve
found
out
true
onli
with
the
phantom
menac
which
wa
veri
poorli
direct
and
edit
piec
of
film
attack
of
the
clone
in
the
other
hand
is
in
comparison
a
superior
achiev
from
pm
but
it
doe
contain
coupl
of
unnecessari
segment
which
drag
the
speed
of
the
film
down
and
some
of
the
act
is
even
in
the
standard
of
the
star
war
pretti
horribl
but
happili
all
those
under
achiev
are
not
in
ani
import
role
and
season
actor
like
christoph
lee
count
dooku
do
deliv
what
you
expect
of
them
other
deserv
nomin
here
are
samuel
l
jackson
as
mace
windu
and
ian
mcdiarmid
as
palpatin
so
the
plot
obi
wan
kenobi
ewan
mcgregor
and
anakin
skywalk
hayden
christensen
are
told
to
watch
over
senat
padam
natali
portman
becaus
of
assassin
attempt
toward
her
life
thi
soon
lead
in
obi
in
discoveri
of
secretli
manufactur
clone
armi
who
is
behind
all
thi
will
padam
and
anakin
fall
in
love
when
doe
anakin
fall
in
to
the
dark
side
will
he
becom
a
jedi
befor
all
thi
some
of
these
question
are
partli
answer
in
aotc
but
some
are
left
wait
for
the
third
instal
of
the
new
trilog
but
as
said
thi
is
much
better
film
than
phantom
menac
it
s
not
best
film
in
the
star
war
saga
but
in
my
opinion
it
doe
deliv
it
s
mostli
fun
to
watch
action
sequenc
are
good
special
effect
are
even
better
and
despis
some
bad
act
and
some
pretti
horribl
dialog
it
wasn
t
pain
in
the
back
side
to
watch
so
my
advis
don
t
listen
to
roar
star
war
fan
who
claim
thi
movi
to
be
one
of
the
worst
thing
ever
and
don
t
listen
to
those
who
claim
thi
one
to
be
best
thing
sinc
slice
bread
attack
of
the
clone
is
abov
averag
but
not
the
greatest
thing
ever
either
