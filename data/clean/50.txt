it
all
rais
doubt
that
is

beyond

suspicion
if

they
play

they

thi

it
should
be

heavili
scrutin

the
microcosm
and
the

that
had
alway
been

up
to
that
point
thi
elitist
spin
on

medicin
character
by
the

“

is
a
fals

will

one
of

basic
critiqu

is
for
exampl
the
tradit

of

as
in
take
a
bunch
of
differ
stori
and
creat
them
as

narr

thi
it
is
challeng
that
mcgowan

be
read
in

entireti
a
list
of

are
much
easier
to
dismiss
than
an
entir
research
novel
and
“
coincid
”
can
onli
explain
so
much
speak
of
which
is
it
all
just
“
coincid
”
that
laurel
canyon
wa
home
to
a
lookout
mountain
air
forc
station
which
admittedli
serv
as
covert
militari
intellig
gather
befor
and
dure
the

’
s
revolut
–
and
that
it
wa
shutdown
directli
after
thi
era
furthermor
while
lo
angel
and
laurel
canyon
are
now
known
as
music
mecca
of
the
west
it
is
often
forgotten
that
thi
scene
wa
directli
stimul
by
all
the
musician
of
the
1960
’

movement
these
varieti
of
artist
had
no
discern
reason
to
flock
to
laurel
canyon
all
at
onc
and
even
more
far
fetch
is
the
idea
that
all
of
these
artist
who
coincident
flock
to

canyon
would
also
be
renegad
of
famili
with
gener
histori
as
high

militari
oper
one
can
ration
all
they
like
but
the
realiti
is
thi
the
further
the
specif
are
flesh
out
about
the
1960
’
s
anti

new

clearer
it

that
thi

an
“

and
wa
in
no

meant
to

embolden
the

at

all
what

let
us
not

the
“

”
fsm
across

from
the
height
in
s
f
at

–
1964

and
earlier
the

…
all
connect
in

way
along
with
mo

and
chess
record
and
other
influenc
the
hippi
movement
i
think
the
free
speech
movement
wa
a
colleg
campu
phenomenon
inspir
first
by
the
struggl
for
civil
right
and
later
wa
driven
by
opposit
to
the
vietnam
war
as
sd
grew
out
of
the
fsm
and
move
to
other
sit
in
at
columbia
univers
and
elsewher
today
the
fsm
is
even
institution
as
a

’
at
the
moffitt
librari
in

middl
of

berkley
campu
it
would
be
a

i
think
if
“

”
were
embrac
insid
the
classroom

the

of

also

wa
also
arguabl

about

though
mayb
for

reason
it
is

of

what
we
might
term
a

eclectic
and
as
i
said
befor
reflect

strong

in

the
more
extrem
the
deep
green
deni
that
such
item
are
even

for

thi

stem

that
is
the
sourc
of

hippi
show

similar

for

trap

a
desir
to
go

find
their
own
walden

we
can
easili
demonstr
that

romant
featur
these
point
i
would
maintain
are
fairli

it
is
arguabl
that

had
alreadi
lost

religion
and
pretti
soon
becam
equal
disench
with
materialist
scienc
and

altern
you
might
say
they
dislik
industri
and
then
lost
their
religion
it
amount
to
the
same
result
thu
they
came
to
occupi
a
rather
uncomfort
posit
in
relat
to
both
we
might
term
the
philosophi
they
ultim
formul
as
a
form
of
sentiment
human
and
the
art
they
seem
to
believ
in
the
digniti
and
sacr
natur
of
human
life
but
not
in
formal
religion
scienc
cut
across
one
viewpoint
and
religion
across
the
other
while
thi
becam
their
person
refug
and
saviour
ideolog
it
fell
between
both
stool
of
scienc
and
religion
the
romant
viewpoint
therefor
appear
to
stem
from
a
cultur
vacuum
deriv
from
a
disenchant
with
and
reject
of
both
ideolog
on
offer
at
the
time
or
at
least
an
ambival
non
commit
toward
both
yet
it
is
also
true
take
a
differ
tack
that
not
all
romant
were
romant
just
as
not
all
hippi
were
hippi
or
all
peac
activist
are
that
peac
just
as
not
all
hippi
live
in
teepe
or
even
wish
to
so
not
all
eco
activist
wreck
factori
farm
or
break
into
vivisect
laboratori
so
there
are
distinct
shade
of
belief
within
each
movement
and
one
presum
that
these
reflect
differ
shade
of
commit
to
a
central
pillar
of
idea
in
all
these
movement
there
exist
a
high
degre
of
toler
toward
an
outer
fring

casual
taker
and
intellectu
migrant
ideolog
browser
who
come
along
to
sit
and
dabbl
in
a
pool
of
idea
for
a
time
and
then
move
on
to
establish
more
concret
link
between
eco
activist
hippi
and
romanc
we
would
need
to
trace
the
more
distant
origin
both
of
romantic
and
of
what
i
would
term
the
romant
impuls
their
anti

might
be
seen
as
anoth
aspect

their
subjectiv
their

lean
i
will
touch

as
for

methodolog
we
need
to
explor
their
languag

of

it

alreadi

went

we

at
it
in

a
situat
we
are
perfectli
entitl

act

of

had
paid

defer

would
one
wonder
anyth
have
been
discov
of

valu
mani
peopl
seem

believ
that
hippi
display
an
aspect
of
60
s
cultur
which
wa
veri
anti
establish
and
rebelli
whatev
their
histor
origin
in
the
emerg
post
war
pop
cultur
which
probabl
requir
an
essay
in
it
own
right
we
might
decid
that
hippi
were
keen
to
reject
most
of
the
cosi
and
accept
middl
class
norm
of
modern
ie
post
war
life
in
that
sens
they
seem
to
bear
littl
resembl
to
a
superfici
view
of
the
romant
of
the
19th
centuri
in
fact
the
19th
centuri
romant
were
probabl
far
more
rebelli
than
we
think
beat
and
hippi
certainli
seem
to
want
to
turn
life
upsid
down
and
reject
everyth
i
think
thi
is
a
mistaken
view
in
some
respect
we
should
perhap
distinguish
more
clearli
between
60
s
cultur
as
polit
activ
in
it
wider
sens
of
be
veri
clearli
anti
author
and
rebelli
which
is
one
distinct
thread
perfectli
valid
in
it
own
right
but
then
there
are
also
the
peac
romant
pastor
drug
craze
and
mystic
hippi
i
think
they
might
for
conveni
be
view
separ
from
the
highli
politic
rebelli
sub
group
marxist
of
cours
it
is
chiefli
the
peac
love
hippi
i
have
been
write
about
rather
than
the
marxist
and
thi
distinguish
between
hippi
per
se
and
gener
60
s
cultur
i
therefor
believ
that
there
were
at
least
2
distinct
variant
one
highli
politic
and
protest
anti
establish
and
the
other
romant
dreami
artist
pacifist
and
mystic
both
were
rebelli
in
variou
way
but
the
hippi
less
so
polit
than
the
marxist
hippi
more
social
and
ideolog
rebelli
mayb
howev
instead
of
goeth

would
more
like

in

respect
the

60

can
be
view
as
a
period
of

the
rebellion
by

against

about
the

we
live
in
to
me
there
is
littl
doubt
that
leari
ginsberg
and
co
were
encourag
youth
to
rebel
against
author
and
to
take
greater
confid
in
their

to

gain

thi
and
to
resist

repel
ani

the

gave

a

these
might
be
seen
as
genuin
search
for
mean
in
an
appar
uncar
and
mechanist
univers
in
the
abov
sens
therefor
i
find
it
fairli
transpar
that
hippi
and
eco
activist
appear
befor
us
as
slighti
differ
fruit
on
the
same
tree
as
their
forebear
the
romant
and
thu
from
thi
thesi
we
might
decid
that
romanc
even
in
our
modern
scienc
domin
world
could
be
perceiv
as
a
genuin
perenni
philosophi
with
strong
root
seem
to
plung
down
deep
into
our
collect
psych
and
which
seem
period
to
throw
up
vibrant
new
shoot
of
renew
activ
and
even
vigor
growth
no
matter
how
effici
or
frequent
it
gnarl
old
branch
get
hack
down
by
what
we
might
term
the
chain
saw
of
scientif
progress
in
thi
sens
therefor
i
am
tempt
to
disagre
with
the
notion
that
romanc
is
end
transform
itself
again
mayb
ye
but
sure
never
truli
end
final
i
am
tempt
to
conclud
that
the
romant
impuls
ha
alway
exist
and
is
an
integr
part
of
our
conscious
period
it
get
abus
chop
down
and
buri
but
then
it
reappear
strang
new
shine
phoenix
like
hydra
head
gussi
up
in
new

as
new
ideolog
which
seem
radic
differ
but
which
upon
closer
inspect
share
an
underli
golden
thread
which
run
through
them
all
they
are
branch
from
the
same
tree
and
that
tradit
we
can
sure
trace
back
even
further
befor
the
enlighten
and
beyond
the
renaiss
into
neoplaton
plotinu
eriugena
and
then
back
to
plato
and
the
great
and
also
through
the
secret
tradit
back
to
ancient
egypt
pythagora
and
the
like
declin
of
hippi
we
now
come
to
anoth
problem
of
whi
they
declin
and
fade
from
view
well
they
fade
veri
slowli
and
were
still
around
up
to
1980
or
so
in
consider
number
they
seem
to
diminish
veri
fast
in
the
earli
80
s
and
were
gone
complet
by
1986
perhap
mani
of
their
ideal
had
been
realis
in
a
discreet
and
subtl

peopl
did
becom
more
loosen
up

of

it
did
not

the

jerusalem

in
that

disappoint
set
in
and
it

the

had
fail
to
chang
those

of

dope

were
not

and
they
probabl
never
were
the
panacea
for
all

s
ill
as
extol
by
leari
and
ginsberg
thu
the
dream
turn
sour
and

persist
onli
here
and
there
in
a
dwindl
pocket
of
follow
further
ramblingsw
have
so
far
been
stress
that
60
s
contain
at
least
two
subcultur
strand
pacifist
hippi
and
marxist
we
can
probabl
go
further
and
call
it
a
multithread
cultur
or
period
and
that
enabl
us
to
identifi
sever
strand
within
it
for
exampl
there
were
straight
dopefiend
there
were
vegetarian
and
wholist
health
organ
and
environment
type
there
were
pure
politico
such
as
the
marxist
maoist
anarchist
etc
there
were
also
pure
pop
music
and
rock
music
freak
who
did
not
go
for
the
other
stuff
entir
but
were
just
eclect
accord
to
their
own
tast
final
there
were
the
leari
and
ginsberg
free
wheel
chang
the
world
through
dope
and
free
love
type
you
could
go
on
identifi
more
and
more
fine
split
within
the
movement
and
between
the
differ
faction
but
if
we
just
choos
to
say
there
were
mani
differ
subtyp
within
a
two
way
split
cultur
i
think
that
will
suffic
two
question
therefor
aris
first
whi
were
they
share
one
cultur
if
they
were
so
differ
and
second
what
featur
actual
unit
them
into
one
cultur
these
are
opposit
side
of
the
same
coin
were
they
one
cultur
and
agre
on
everyth
i
don
t
think
so
we
both
have
shown
variou
way
in
which
they
were
quit
distinct
from
one
anoth
therefor
we
need
to
identifi
those
common
underli
idea
which
they
did
share
and
which
broadli
identifi
them
as
sixti
person
i
would
provision
suggest
that
all
the
sub
group
basic
share
at
least
the
follow
featur
in
common
youth
the
new
neophiliac
music
freedom
of
express
liber
eg
dope
and
sex
artist
express
in
it
veri
broadest
and
most
gener
sens
includ
even
the
crassest
stuff
ideal
chang
the
world
that
chang
is
possibl
revolut
chang
the
person
in
their
head
and
you
chang
the
world
chang
the
world
and
societi
and
structur
and
you
can
chang
peopl
in
their
head
chang
just
for
chang
sake
toler
of
all
viewpoint
and
idea
demonstr
and
protest
against
what
you
dislik
and
for
what
you
do
want
or
just
drop
out
and
set
up
your
own
altern
cultur
do
your
own
thing
have
confid
in
do
what
is
right
for
you
onc
we
identifi
these
common
strand
which
underpin
the
whole
era
we
can
then
see
that
the
differ
between
the
variou
subgroup
were
more
appar
than
real
and
that
they
all
swam
in
the
same
river
to
such
a
huge
degre
that
these
differ
did
not
realli
matter
veri
much
nor
did
they
add
up
in
ani
big
deal
way
to
make
a
huge
differ
most
of
the
time
ani
so
call
friction
between
the
differ
subgroup
wa
minim
becaus
there
wa
a
vast
terrain
of
common
of
basic
flow
of
event
which
everyon
approv
of
and
agre
about
they
approv
of
most
thing
that
happen
becaus
most
thing
that
happen
were
in
accord
with
the
abov
list
and
therefor
obtain
the
approv
of
all
that
wa
true
for
a
remark
long
period
of
time
from
late
the
50
s
right
through
to
mid
70
s
gener
speak
then
it
began
to
break
up
becam
stale
peopl
split
off
into
much
more
distinct
group
and
most
import
of
all
the
underpin
framework
of
common
began
to
fragment
and
break
up
the
attract
for
freedom
of
express
and
the
new
and
youth
and
art
began
to
fade
and
peopl
began
to
becom
obsess
with
other
thing
like
job
money
partner
and
children
buy
a
hous
etc
and
the
whole
dream
fade
from
view
and
move
from
centr
stage
into
a
blur
background
reason
shift
of
viewpoint
tire
of
do
the
same
old
thing
new
perspect
new
attract
boredom
anyhow
the
friction
that
were
previous
happili
toler
as
minor
and
insignific
now
becam
amplifi
and
massiv
import
and
that
may
be
whi
in
retrospect
analys
everyon
see
the
decad
in
radic
differ
way
and
that
is
whi
it
interpret
in
the
media
and
it
digest
in
the
public
mind
ha
been
so
problemat
and
whi
so
mani
divers
idea
have
sprung
up
about
what
the
decad
meant
and
what
it
underli
vice
and
virtu
actual
were
the
end
of
the
hippi
period
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
in
mani
way
it
just
fade
slowli
through
the
mid
70
s
it
essenc
wa
certainli
still
around
strongli
in
1976
but
my
guess
is
that
the
rise
of
violent
anti
past
glori
punk
in
1976
80
the
elect
of
right
wing
dictatori
figur
like
thatcher
may
1979
and
reagan
1980
and
the
shoot
of
lennon
in
dec
1980
certainli
seem
to
contribut
to
it
rapid
termin
ill
and
probabl
drove
the
final
nail
into
it
coffin
punk
is
an
essay
in
it
own
right
of
cours
and
it
is
veri
much
an
anti
author
thing
again
but
ugli
repuls
violent
excess
and
most
definit
anti
hippi
and
anti
laid
back
man
and
let
it
all
hang
out
thi
remind
me
of
the
who
i
don
t
think
they
were
quit
that
antipolit
they
were
apolit
perhap
but
most
definit
anti
author
anti
old
peopl
anti

anti

anti

old
fusspot
who
ran
the
place
etc
etc
they
had
veri
violent
stage
show
and
a
violent
manic
drummer
some
song
lyric
it
is
use
to
compar
lennon
s
revolut
with
harrison
s
within
you
without
you
becaus
it
illustr
what
i
have
said
befor
and
abov
it
might
actual
be
bettter
to
compar
some
dylan
stuff
as
well
or
to
bring
in
donovan
the
who
string
band
or
pete
seeger
et
al
to
illustr
other
import
viewpoint
within
you
without
you
contain
the
follow
line
peopl
who
hide
themselv
behind
a
wall
of
illus
never
glimps
the
truth
then
it
far
too
late
when
they
pass
away
with
our
love
we
could
save
the
world
tri
to
realis
it
all
within
yourself
no
one
els
can
make
you
chang
and
the
peopl
who
gain
the
world
and
lose
their
soul
they
don
t
know
they
can
t
see
are
you
one
of
them
the
abov
is
veri
similar
to
all
you
need
is
love
and
carri
a
messag
that
onli
love
can
realli
chang
the
world
becaus
onli
it
chang
peopl
in
their
heart
and
also
that
cash
and
wealth
and
power
and
statu
are
not
the
answer
and
do
not
lead
to
happi
peac
of
mind
etc
in
the
way
peopl
think
they
just
add
to
your
problem
rather
than
solv
them
so
there
wa
a
definit
friction
between
what
the
peac
and
love
hippi
were
say
and
what
the
marxist
were
say
it
is
clear
and
undeni
that
is
what
i
meant
by
two
polaris
sub
group
or
movement
coexist
within
one
broader
movement
also
in
thi
song
is
the
idea
that
onli
intern
chang
within
you
can
chang
you
or
your
own
world
not
extern
chang
and
more
importantli
not
extern
impos
chang
in
the
structur
of
societi
as
recommend
by
marxist
that
at
least
is
one
interpret
it
is
certainli
the
interpret
i
place
on
it
throughout
the
period
we
have
been
discuss
revolut
you
say
you
want
a
revolut
well
you
know
we
all
want
to
chang
the
world
you
tell
me
that
it
evolut
well
you
know
we
all
want
to
chang
the
world
but
when
talk
about
destruct
don
t
you
know
that
you
can
count
me
out
you
say
you
got
a
real
solut
well
you
know
we
d
love
to
see
the
plan
you
ask
me
for
a
contribut
well
you
know
we
re
do
what
we
can
but
when
you
want
money
for
peopl
with
mind
that
hate
all
i
can
tell
you
is
brother
you
have
to
wait
you
say
you
ll
chang
the
constitut
well
you
know
we
all
want
to
chang
your
head
you
tell
me
it
s
the
institut
well
you
know
you
better
free
your

instead
but
if
you
go
carri
pictur
of
chairman
mao
you
ain
t

make
it
with

thi
poem
is
clearli
a
tirad
against
a
certain
type
of
revolut
which
involv
hate
the
rich
kill
the
rich
as
i
previous
said
and
lennon
want
no
part
of
that
but
he
doe
want
a
revolut
of
free
mind
and
free
head
which
is
peac
and
a
la
ginsberg
and
leari
perhap
a
slightli
dilut
version
of
what
they
were
offer
mayb
lennon
had
obvious
thought
about
both
type
of
revolut
on
offer
at
the
time
and
decid
he
want
a
soft

is
a
brilliant
condens
outlin
of
the
hippi
phenomenon
the
structur
of
societi
are
not
chang
through
sit
and
smoke
dope
get
high
but
nor
are
peopl
chang
within
by
chang
the
structur
of
societi
so
both
are
right
in
their
critiqu
of
each
other
and
the
hippi
seem
more
right
than
the
marxist
in
the
last
analysi
becaus
it
doe
not
matter
what
you
chang
in
societi
if
peopl
are
fundament
unhappi
in
their
heart
then
no
real
chang
ha
been
effect
and
materi
gain
is
not
happi
that
is
the
hippi
view
and
it
is
still
mostli
my
own
view
i
think
it
is
a
sensibl
view
while
hippi
were
dreamer
and
naiv
so
were
marxist
but
while
the
latter
dream
that
their
action
would
chang
the
world
the
hippi
dream
their
inact
could
chang
the
world
mayb
both
were
right
and
wrong
in
differ
way
but
to
me
the
marxist
were
more
profoundli
wrong
and
they
would
caus
pain
and
suffer
as
well
which
the
hippi
did
not
caus
the
term
hippi
is
just
a
conveni
phrase
it
ha
a
blur
mean
perhap
but
i
still
think
it
ha
a
quit
distinct
mean
compar
with
marxist
and
i
do
believ
both
group
exist
domin
the
movement
were
not
veri
compat
and
did
gener
a
tension
within
the
movement
and
even
within
individu
i
do
not
accept
koestler
s
theme
of
yogi
and
commissar
which
seem
trite
and
simplist
a
borrow
argument
that
ring
hollow
in
my
view
state
and
big
busi
are
were
antithet
as
busi
wa
to
make
certain
peopl
rich
period
state
wa
at
least
aim
to
benefit
all
not
just
an
elit
busi
wa
never
condon
by
hippi
it
wa
toler
the
sens
of
uniti
theme
domin
those
time
or
common
wa
a
form
of
brotherhood
sisterhood
rather
than
uniti
it
wa
as
if
everyon
sail
like
boat
in
the
same
river
for
a
time
and
there
wa
a
unifi
sens
of
experi
and
togeth
togeth
now
there
s
a
60
s
buzz
word
par
excel
the
natur
of
art
also
becam
a
veri
import
theme
in
the
60
s
i
think
one
of
the
main
purpos
of
all
art
is
to
portray
and
enter
into
that
search
for
reintegr
of
self
and
world
and
to
achiev
a
renew
balanc
for
mani
it
is
sure
the
sole
purpos
of
their
life
art
is
thu
v
often
both
a
portray
of
the
search
and
the
product
of
it
both
at
onc
i
do
not
agre
that
it
is
imposs
to
regain
entri
into
that
eden
world
of
childhood
i
think
mani
in
fact
do
achiev
that
in
a
sens
and
it
is
arguabl
that
the
romant
poet
did
achiev
that
fairli
success
i
do
not
accept
that
children
onli
dwell
in
the
now
they
also
occasioanlli
drift
into
reveri
of
past
and
futur
but
you
are
right
that
they
are
more
centr
in
the
now
than
anywher
els
also
it
is
not
entir
true
that
we
adult
cannot
view
directli
or
see
the
world
as
children
do
i
think
again
it
is
far
more
complex
and
some
of
the
time
we
do
see
thing
directli
the
distinct
between
childhood
and
adulthood
is
perhap
fals
mayb
there
are
cultur
filter
on
our
percept
through
grow
up
which
act
against
the
direct
view
you
mention
these
are
wordsworth
s
convent
mayb
the
refin
state
of
the
poet
is
also
in
mani
way
akin
to
the
rarifi
state
of
conscious
describ
by
mystic
and
medit
of
all
type
and
in
all
cultur
and
epoch
there
is
a
parallel
i
suppos
in
want
to
be
in
that
pure
state
whether
in
natur
away
from
other
and
also
in
the
child
s
state
of
innoc
and
direct
view
i
think
these
are
most
certainli
central
import
featur
of
idealist
and
romant
thought
they
also
crop
up
in
the
recreat
use
of
drug
as
they
were
attempt
arguabl
to
reach
back
into
that
primordi
state
of
pre
adult
and
direct
view
by
use
mind
alter
substanc
drug
use
wa
mainli
opium
in
the
last
centuri
but
as
we
know
in
the
romant
hippi
sixti
epoch
it
wa
chiefli
marijuhana
and
lsd
i
think
there
is
a
parallel
again
becaus
hippi
were
like
wordsworth
wish
to
separ
themselv
off
from
a
corrupt
