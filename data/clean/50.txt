cultur
in
relat

the
romant
tradit
the
histori
of
idea
by
peter
morrel
there
is
a
broad
parallel
between
environment
and
hippi
in
the
sens
that
they
are
broadli
idealist
seek
to
chang
the
world
and
the
attitud
of
peopl
in
it
thi
is
in
some
way
similar
to
the
earli
romant
in
both
case
i
also
think
they
are
definit
reaction
to
a
rise
domin
cultur
enlighten
then
or
scientif
materi
now
which
the
romant
stoutli
reject
as
disturb
unpleas
or
inhuman
for
exampl
rousseau
s
ambival
both
toward
scienc
and
organis
religion
is
reflect
today
in
mani
environmentalist
who
want
to
keep
the
best
of
modern
scientif
worldview
and
progress
eg
dishwash
some
bleach
and
deterg
live
in
hous
rather
than
teepe
but
who
then
want
to
reject
it
nastier
bit
like
nuclear
power
vivisect
and
intens
farm
hippi
likewis
be
at
least
suspici
of
if
not
oppos
outright
to
scientif
materi
environmentalist
and
hippi
certainli
seem
keen
to
retain
some
kind
of
spiritu
or
holist
paradigm
within
their
live
but
they
appear
to
share
a
reject
of
system
of
rigid
dogma
which
they
might
see
as
be
ram
down
your
throat
or
appli
as
a
straitjacket
to
your
moral
conduct
thi
could
be
the
chief
sourc
of
their
reaction
against
most
form
of
orthodox
religion
their
rural
pastor
and
pantheism
both
evok
the
nobl
savag
of
rousseau
as
they
espous
back
to
natur
and
the
superior
of
natur
therapi
and
natur
lifestyl
along
with
variou
form
of
orient
eg
gandhi

confuciu
taoism
thi
natur
ha

be

for

pollut
the

hippi

also
espous
share
thing
and
benign
and
peac
cooper
both
between
individu
and
with
natur
itself
they
are
both
broadli
anti

thi
pacif
as
we
might
choos
to
call
it
is
clearli
an

characterist
featur
they
both
share
it
is
also
found
to
some
degre
perhap
in

more
embryon
form
amongst
the
earli
romant

of
cours
found
best
express
both
in
the
french
revolut
slogan
libert
egalit
fraternit
and
in
the
work
of
tom
pain
and
the
american
declar
of
independ
though
we
would
be
hard
push
to
find
evid
of
it
in
the
behaviour
of
the
revolutionist
themselv
nevertheless
it
wa
an
idea
swim
around
in
that
idealist
cocktail
of
idea
current
at
that
time
mani
befor
us
have
also
trace
social
and
commun
to
the
profound
ideal
and
egalitarian
of
the
1790
s
it
also
find
express
in
the
intens
rural
of
mani
of
the
painter
and
poet
of
the
earli
romant
period
thu
the
spirit
of
those
time
wa
also
arguabl
center
about
the
idea
of
human
digniti
freedom
and
friendship
to
all
peopl
inde
it
is
also
found
as
an
integr
part
of
the
spirit
of
the
found
father
of
the
usa
i
would
ventur
that
all
of
that
come
veri
close
to
the
egalit

commun
ism
of
hippi
and
eco
activist
though
mayb
for
differ
reason
it
is
well
known
that
mani
of
the
first
european
romant
were
anti
industrialist
who
rebel

the
ugliest

of

out

veri
much
like

hippi

what
we
might
term
a

eclectic
and
as
i
said
befor
reflect
a
strong
ambival
toward

in

of

the

appear

at

at

an

yet
it
is
also
true
take
a
differ

that
not
all
romant
were
romant
just

not

were

there
are
distinct

that

of
commit

in

there
exist
a

browser
who
come
along

for

and
then
move
on
to
establish
more
concret
link
between
eco
activist
hippi
and
romanc
we
would
need
to
trace
the
more
distant
origin
both
of
romantic
and
of
what
i
would
term
the

impuls
their

their

for

methodolog
we
need

most
of

it

from

we
are
perfectli
entitl
to

evalu

if

would
one
wonder
anyth
have

discov
of

valu
mani
peopl
seem
to
believ
that
hippi
display
an
aspect
of
60
s
cultur
which
wa
veri
anti
establish
and
rebelli
whatev
their
histor
origin
in
the
emerg
post
war
pop
cultur
which
probabl
requir
an
essay
in
it
own
right
we
might
decid
that
hippi
were
keen
to
reject
most
of
the
cosi
and
accept
middl
class
norm
of
modern
ie
post
war
life
in
that
sens
they
seem
to
bear
littl
resembl
to
a
superfici
view
of
the
romant
of
the
19th
centuri
in
fact
the
19th
centuri
romant
were
probabl
far
more
rebelli
than
we
think
beat
and
hippi
certainli
seem
to
want
to
turn
life
upsid
down
and
reject
everyth
i
think
thi
is
a
mistaken
view
in
some
respect
we
should
perhap
distinguish
more
clearli
between
60
s
cultur
as
polit
activ
in
it
wider
sens
of
be
veri
clearli
anti
author
and
rebelli
which
is
one
distinct
thread
perfectli
valid
in
it
own
right
but
then
there
are
also
the
peac
romant
pastor
drug
craze
and
mystic
hippi
i
think
they
might
for
conveni
be
view
separ
from
the
highli
politic
rebelli
sub
group
marxist
of
cours
it
is
chiefli
the
peac
love
hippi
i
have
been
write
about
rather
than
the
marxist
and
thi
distinguish
between
hippi
per
se
and
gener
60
s
cultur
i
therefor
believ
that
there
were
at
least
2
distinct
variant
one
highli
politic
and
protest
anti
establish
and
the
other
romant
dreami
artist
pacifist
and
mystic
both
were
rebelli
in
variou
way
but
the
hippi
less
so
polit
than
the
marxist
hippi
more
social

respect
the

60

can
be
view
as
a
period
of
rebellion
the
rebellion
by

against

the

to

about
the

we
live
in
to
me
there
is
littl
doubt
that
leari
ginsberg
and
co
were
encourag
youth
to
rebel
against
author
and
to
take
greater
confid
in
their

to

gain

thi
and
to
resist

repel
ani

the

a

ie
freethink

be
as
oppos

the
receiv

and
b
the
activ
search
by
such
freed

system
of

eg

through

and

new
turn
outward
away
from

and
toward
the
outer
physic
world
thi
new
situat
in
turn
gave
rise
to
a
new
breed
of
peopl
with
a
sceptic
view
of
religion
with
littl
or
no
religion
at
all
and
certainli
with

with

a

that

of

a

as

human
run
around
like

with

is
a
fairli
justifi
interpret
to
make
of
the

clockwork
vision
conjur
up
by
folk
like
hobb
descart
and
newton
whether
it
wa
intend
by
them
in
that
way
or
not
thu
from
1700
s
on
through
to
1900
s
we
find
folk
search
for
spiritu
mean
and
reassur
in
a
darken
world
it
is
my
content
that
that
search
still
continu
now
and
occasion
erupt
into
new
movement
such
as
hippi
and
eco
activ
it
is
a
process
which
is
still
activ
and
which
may
never
die
out
complet
as
i
am
sure
mani
hippi
and
eco
activist
would
say
mean
might
prove
ultim
to
be
a
far
more
preciou
commod
to
us
than
the
myriad
tangibl
materi
comfort
which
scienc
and
technolog
have
bestow
upon
us
as
also
impli
in
the
end
of
the
film
silent
run
or
as
also
seen
in
the
more
recent
event
at
waco
and
the
san
diego
hale
bopp
mass
suicid
these
might
be
seen
as
genuin
search
for
mean
in
an
appar
uncar
and
mechanist
univers
in
the
abov
sens
therefor
i
find
it
fairli
transpar
that
hippi
and
eco
activist
appear
befor
us
as
slighti
differ
fruit
on
the
same
tree
as
their
forebear
the
romant
and
thu
from
thi
thesi
we
might
decid
that
romanc
even
in
our
modern
scienc
domin
world
could
be
perceiv
as
a
genuin
perenni
philosophi
with
strong
root
seem
to
plung
down
deep
into
our
collect
psych
and
which
seem
period
to
throw
up
vibrant
new
shoot
of
renew
activ
and
even
vigor
growth
no
matter
how
effici
or
frequent
it
gnarl
old
branch
get
hack
down
by
what
we
might
term
the
chain
saw
of
scientif
progress
in
thi
sens
therefor
i
am
tempt
to
disagre
with
the
notion
that
romanc
is
end
transform
itself
again
mayb
ye
but
sure
never
truli
end
final
i
am
tempt
to
conclud
that
the
romant
impuls
ha
alway
exist
and
is
an
integr
part
of
our
conscious
period
it
get
abus
chop
down
and
buri
but
then
it
reappear
strang
new
shine
phoenix
like
hydra
head
gussi
up
in
new
cloth
as
new
ideolog
which
seem
radic
differ
but
which
upon
closer
inspect
share
an
underli
golden
thread
which
run
through
them
all
they
are
branch
from
the
same
tree
and
that
tradit
we
can
sure
trace
back
even
further
befor
the
enlighten
and
beyond
the
renaiss
into
neoplaton
plotinu
eriugena
and
then
back
to
plato
and
the
great
and
also
through
the
secret
tradit
back
to
ancient
egypt
pythagora
and
the
like
declin
of
hippi
we
now
come
to
anoth
problem
of
whi
they
declin
and
fade
from
view
well
they
fade
veri
slowli
and
were
still
around
up
to
1980
or
so
in
consider
number
they
seem
to
diminish
veri
fast
in
the
earli
80
s
and
were
gone
complet
by
1986
perhap
mani
of
their
ideal
had
been
realis
in
a
discreet
and
subtl

peopl
did
becom
more
loosen
up
and
liber

awar
of

ecolog
and

expans
but
it
did
not
chang
the

the
long
for

did
not
come
and
jerusalem
wa
not

here
in
that
sens
disappoint
set
in
and
it
gradual
fade
the
movement
had
fail
to
chang
those
larg
and
immov
structur
of
all
societi
dope
and
acid
were
not
legalis
and
they
probabl
never
were
the
panacea
for
all
societi
s
ill
as
extol
by
leari
and
ginsberg
thu
the
dream
turn
sour
and
fade
persist
onli
here
and
there
in
a
dwindl
pocket
of
follow
further
ramblingsw
have
so
far
been
stress
that
60
s
contain
at
least
two
subcultur
strand
pacifist
hippi
and
marxist
we
can
probabl
go
further
and
call
it
a
multithread
cultur
or
period
and
that
enabl
us
to
identifi
sever
strand
within
it
for
exampl
there
were
straight
dopefiend
there
were
vegetarian
and
wholist
health
organ
and
environment
type
there
were
pure
politico
such
as
the
marxist
maoist
anarchist
etc
there
were
also
pure
pop
music
and
rock
music
freak
who
did
not
go
for
the
other
stuff
entir
but
were
just
eclect
accord
to
their
own
tast
final
there
were
the
leari
and
ginsberg
free
wheel
chang
the
world
through
dope
and
free
love
type
you
could
go
on
identifi
more
and
more
fine
split
within
the
movement
and
between
the
differ
faction
but
if
we
just
choos
to
say
there
were
mani
differ
subtyp
within
a
two
way
split
cultur
i
think
that
will
suffic
two
question
therefor
aris
first
whi
were
they
share
one
cultur
if
they
were
so
differ
and
second
what
featur
actual
unit
them
into
one
cultur
these
are
opposit
side
of
the
same
coin
were
they
one
cultur
and
agre
on
everyth
i
don
t
think
so
we
both
have
shown
variou
way
in
which
they
were
quit
distinct
from
one
anoth
therefor
we
need
to
identifi
those
common
underli
idea
which
they
did
share
and
which
broadli
identifi
them
as
sixti
person
i
would
provision
suggest
that
all
the
sub
group
basic
share
at
least
the
follow
featur
in
common
youth
the
new
neophiliac
music
freedom
of
express
liber
eg
dope
and
sex
artist
express
in
it
veri
broadest
and
most
gener
sens
includ
even
the
crassest
stuff
ideal
chang
the
world
that
chang
is
possibl
revolut
chang
the
person
in
their
head
and
you
chang
the
world
chang
the
world
and
societi
and
structur
and
you
can
chang
peopl
in
their
head
chang
just
for
chang
sake
toler
of
all
viewpoint
and
idea
demonstr
and
protest
against
what
you
dislik
and
for
what
you
do
want
or
just
drop
out
and
set
up
your
own
altern
cultur
do
your
own
thing
have
confid
in
do
what
is
right
for
you
onc
we
identifi
these
common
strand
which
underpin
the
whole
era
we
can
then
see
that
the
differ
between
the
variou
subgroup
were
more
appar
than
real
and
that
they
all
swam
in
the
same
river
to
such
a
huge
degre
that
these
differ
did
not
realli
matter
veri
much
nor
did
they
add
up
in
ani
big
deal
way
to
make
a
huge
differ
most
of
the
time
ani
so
call
friction
between
the
differ
subgroup
wa
minim
becaus
there
wa
a
vast
terrain
of
common
of
basic
flow
of
event
which
everyon
approv
of
and
agre
about
they
approv
of
most
thing
that
happen
becaus
most
thing
that
happen
were
in
accord
with
the
abov
list
and
therefor
obtain
the
approv
of
all
that
wa
true
for
a
remark
long
period
of
time
from
late
the
50
s
right
through
to
mid
70
s
gener
speak
then
it
began
to
break
up
becam
stale
peopl
split
off
into
much
more
distinct
group
and
most
import
of
all
the
underpin
framework
of
common
began
to
fragment
and
break
up
the
attract
for
freedom
of
express
and
the
new
and
youth
and
art
began
to
fade
and
peopl
began
to
becom
obsess
with
other
thing
like
job
money
partner
and
children
buy
a
hous
etc
and
the
whole
dream
fade
from
view
and
move
from
centr
stage
into
a
blur
background
reason
shift
of
viewpoint
tire
of
do
the
same
old
thing
new
perspect
new
attract
boredom
anyhow
the
friction
that
were
previous
happili
toler
as
minor
and
insignific
now
becam
amplifi
and
massiv
import
and
that
may
be
whi
in
retrospect
analys
everyon
see
the
decad
in
radic
differ
way
and
that
is
whi
it
interpret
in
the
media
and
it
digest
in
the
public
mind
ha
been
so
problemat
and
whi
so
mani
divers
idea
have
sprung
up
about
what
the
decad
meant
and
what
it
underli
vice
and
virtu
actual
were
the
end
of
the
hippi
period
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
in
mani
way
it
just
fade
slowli
through
the
mid
70
s
it
essenc
wa
certainli
still
around
strongli
in
1976
but
my
guess
is
that
the
rise
of
violent
anti
past
glori
punk
in
1976
80
the
elect
of
right
wing
dictatori
figur
like
thatcher
may
1979
and
reagan
1980
and
the
shoot
of
lennon
in
dec
1980
certainli
seem
to
contribut
to
it
rapid
termin
ill
and
probabl
drove
the
final
nail
into
it
coffin
punk
is
an
essay
in
it
own
right
of
cours
and
it
is
veri
much
an
anti
author
thing
again
but
ugli
repuls
violent
excess
and
most
definit
anti
hippi
and
anti
laid
back
man
and
let
it
all
hang
out
thi
remind
me
of
the
who
i
don
t
think
they
were
quit
that
antipolit
they
were
apolit
perhap
but
most
definit
anti
author
anti
old
peopl
anti
establish
anti
tori
anti
stuffi
old
fusspot
who
ran
the
place
etc
etc
they
had
veri
violent
stage
show
and
a
violent
manic
drummer
some
song
lyric
it
is
use
to
compar
lennon
s
revolut
with
harrison
s
within
you
without
you
becaus
it
illustr
what
i
have
said
befor
and
abov
it
might
actual
be
bettter
to
compar
some
dylan
stuff
as
well
or
to
bring
in
donovan
the
who
string
band
or
pete
seeger
et
al
to
illustr
other
import
viewpoint
within
you
without
you
contain
the
follow
line
peopl
who
hide
themselv
behind
a
wall
of
illus
never
glimps
the
truth
then
it
far
too
late
when
they
pass
away
with
our
love
we
could
save
the
world
tri
to
realis
it
all
within
yourself
no
one
els
can
make
you
chang
and
the
peopl
who
gain
the
world
and
lose
their
soul
they
don
t
know
they
can
t
see
are
you
one
of
them
the
abov
is
veri
similar
to
all
you
need
is
love
and
carri
a
messag
that
onli
love
can
realli
chang
the
world
becaus
onli
it
chang
peopl
in
their
heart
and
also
that
cash
and
wealth
and
power
and
statu
are
not
the
answer
and
do
not
lead
to
happi
peac
of
mind
etc
in
the
way
peopl
think
they
just
add
to
your
problem
rather
than
solv
them
so
there
wa
a
definit
friction
between
what
the
peac
and
love
hippi
were
say
and
what
the
marxist
were
say
it
is
clear
and
undeni
that
is
what
i
meant
by
two
polaris
sub
group
or
movement
coexist
within
one
broader
movement
also
in
thi
song
is
the
idea
that
onli
intern
chang
within
you
can
chang
you
or
your
own
world
not
extern
chang
and
more
importantli
not
extern
impos
chang
in
the
structur
of
societi
as
recommend
by
marxist
that
at
least
is
one
interpret
it
is
certainli
the
interpret
i
place
on
it
throughout
the
period
we
have
been
discuss
revolut
you
say
you
want
a
revolut
well
you
know
we
all
want
to
chang
the
world
you
tell
me
that
it
evolut
well
you
know
we
all
want
to
chang
the
world
but
when
talk
about
destruct
don
t
you
know
that
you
can
count
me
out
you
say
you
got
a
real
solut
well
you
know
we
d
love
to
see
the
plan
you
ask
me
for
a
contribut
well
you
know
we
re
do
what
we
can
but
when
you
want
money
for
peopl
with

that
hate
all
i
can
tell
you
is
brother
you
have
to
wait
you
say
you
ll
chang
the

well
you
know
we
all
want
to
chang
your

you
tell
me
it
s
the

well
you
know
you
better
free
your

instead
but
if
you
go
carri
pictur
of

mao
you
ain

thi
poem
is
clearli
a
tirad
against
a
certain
type
of

which
involv
hate
the
rich
kill
the
rich
as
i

lennon
want

that
but
he
doe
want

is
a
brilliant
condens
outlin
of
the
hippi
phenomenon
the
structur
of
societi
are
not
chang
through
sit
and
smoke
dope
get
high
but
nor
are
peopl
chang
within
by
chang
the
structur
of
societi
so
both
are
right
in
their
critiqu
of
each
other
and
the
hippi
seem
more
right
than
the
marxist
in
the
last
analysi
becaus
it
doe
not
matter
what
you
chang
in
societi
if
peopl
are
fundament
unhappi
in
their
heart
then
no
real
chang
ha
been
effect
and
materi
gain
is
not
happi
that
is
the
hippi
view
and
it
is
still
mostli
my
own
view
i
think
it
is
a
sensibl
view
while
hippi
were
dreamer
and
naiv
so
were
marxist
but
while
the
latter
dream
that
their
action
would
chang
the
world
the
hippi
dream
their
inact
could
chang
the
world
mayb
both
were
right
and
wrong
in
differ
way
but
to
me
the
marxist
were
more
profoundli
wrong
and
they
would
caus
pain
and
suffer
as
well
which
the
hippi
did
not
caus
the
term
hippi
is
just
a
conveni
phrase
it
ha
a
blur
mean
perhap
but
i
still
think
it
ha
a
quit
distinct
mean
compar
with
marxist
and
i
do
believ
both
group
exist
domin
the
movement
were
not
veri
compat
and
did
gener
a
tension
within
the
movement
and
even
within
individu
i
do
not
accept
koestler
s
theme
of
yogi
and
commissar
which
seem
trite
and
simplist
a
borrow
argument
that
ring
hollow
in
my
view
state
and
big
busi
are
were
antithet
as
busi
wa
to
make
certain
peopl
rich
period
state
wa
at
least
aim
to
benefit
all
not
just
an
elit
busi
wa
never
condon
by
hippi
it
wa
toler
the
sens
of
uniti
theme
domin
those
time
or
common
wa
a
form
of
brotherhood
sisterhood
rather
than
uniti
it
wa
as
if
everyon
sail
like
boat
in
the
same
river
for
a
time
and
there
wa
a
unifi
sens
of
experi
and
togeth
togeth
now
there
s
a
60
s
buzz
word
par
excel
the
natur
of
art
also
becam
a
veri
import
theme
in
the
60
s
i
think
one
of
the
main
purpos
of
all
art
is
to
portray
and
enter
into
that
search
for
reintegr
of
self
and
world
and
to
achiev
a
renew
balanc
for
mani
it
is
sure
the
sole
purpos
of
their
life
art
is
thu
v
often
both
a
portray
of
the
search
and
the
product
of
it
both
at
onc
i
do
not
agre
that
it
is
imposs
to
regain
entri
into
that
eden
world
of
childhood
i
think
mani
in
fact
do
achiev
that
in
a
sens
and
it
is
arguabl
that
the
romant
poet
did
achiev
that
fairli
success
i
do
not
accept
that
children
onli
dwell
in
the
now
they
also
occasioanlli
drift
into
reveri
of
past
and
futur
but
you
are
right
that
they
are
more
centr
in
the
now
than
anywher
els
also
it
is
not
entir
true
that
we
adult
cannot
view
directli
or
see
the
world
as
children
do
i
think
again
it
is
far
more
complex
and
some
of
the
time
we
do
see
thing
directli
the
distinct
between
childhood
and
adulthood
is
perhap
fals
mayb
there
are
cultur
filter
on
our
percept
through
grow
up
which
act
against
the
direct
view
you
mention
these
are
wordsworth
s
convent
mayb
the
refin
state
of
the
poet
is
also
in
mani
way
akin
to
the
rarifi
state
of
conscious
describ
by
mystic
and
medit
of
all
type
and
in
all
cultur
and
epoch
there
is
a
parallel
i
suppos
in
want
to
be
in
that
pure
state
whether
in
natur
away
from
other
and
also
in
the
child
s
state
of
innoc
and
direct
view
i
think
these
are
most
certainli
central
import
featur
of
idealist
and
romant
thought
they
also
crop
up
in
the
recreat
use
of
drug
as
they
were
attempt
arguabl
to
reach
back
into
that
primordi
state
of
pre
adult
and
direct
view
by
use
mind
alter
substanc
drug
use
wa
mainli
opium
in
the
last
centuri
but
as
we
know
in
the
romant
hippi
sixti
epoch
it
wa
chiefli
marijuhana
and
lsd
i
think
there
is
a
parallel
again
becaus
hippi
were
like
wordsworth
wish
to
separ
themselv
off
from
a
corrupt
as
they
saw
it
world
and
to
enter
into
a
pure
childlik
state
i
think
the
hippi
parallel
with
blake
and
wordsworth
are
strike
the
60

also
dwell

the

they
stand
by
what
they

all

all
of
these
issu
have
gain
a
new
wave
of

in

due

of
the

in
the
modern

and
age
most
of
the
critic
of

aris

the
fact
that

they
may

necessarili
call

their
idea
are
align

the
former

with
surpris
precis
and
manag
to
be
just
as
ineffect
when
it
come
to
global
action
it
can
be
best
showcas
by
the

their

accomplish
noth

that

that
is
perhap
the
most
glare
reason
for
the
widespread
critic

the
peopl
behind
it
are
not

wrong
howev
it
should

note
that
there
are

even
though
they
may
not
refer
