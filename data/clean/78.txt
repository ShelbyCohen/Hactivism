the
first
key
point
is
the
role
that
teacher

play
in
the
state
of
oaxaca
in
a
context
where
more
than
30
of
the

thi
mean
that
the
mass
think
of

also
in
the
polit

like

and
in
some
case
like
municip

thi
ideolog
have
creat
a
bilater
relationship
where
teacher
feel
the
need
to
do
someth
for
the
commun
where
they
work
becaus
they
or
at

seem
to
understand
the
precari

it

it

peopl
of

who
saw
a
spark
of
hope
when

whi
are

besid
mani
aspect
the
main
factor
that
mark
appo
as

is
the
factor
that
the

polit

liber
or

becaus
they
saw
that
the

the

expens
of
citizen
bea
torr
2006
anoth
point
that
put
appo
into
the
new
social
movement
in
latin
america
is
the
fact
that
it
wa
abl
to
solidifi
differ
and
vari
ident
creat
a
collect
ideolog
under
which
it
manag
to
support
the
popular
upris
lastli
becaus
of
the
big
number
of
grassroot
organ
that
took
part
in
the
creation
of
appo
it
is
difficult
to
place
it
under
a
particular
type
of
social
movement
it
might
be
seen
as
an
indigen
movement
sinc
a
lot
of
the
organ
were
from
indigen
rural
area
but
most
of
the
peopl
who
took
part
in
the
sit
in
were
common
citizen
from
the
citi
of
oaxaca
also
there
wa
a
branch
made
by

who
