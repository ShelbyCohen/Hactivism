thi
suggest
that

involv

specul
also
continu
about
whether

form
independ

thi
may

the

at

the
pagad

repli
that
the

did
not
do
such
thing
order
such
thing
and
that
such
attack
were
not
part
of
the
group
s

the
pagad
member
went
on
to
say
that
he
could
not
guarante
that
the
individu
or
individu
who
organ
the
bomb
were
not
member

sinc
he
could
not
control
everi

that
while

they

affili
other
agenda
and
may
be

of

not
agre
on

thi
suggest

may

maintain

of

gangster
in

at

may
have
redirect

consid
themselv
in

against
both
the

some

there
ha
been

specul
also
continu
about
the

between
pagad

the

some
sourc
suggest
that
pagad
onli
claim

exist
to
fight

as

for

is

although
the

though
the

it
is
specul
that
