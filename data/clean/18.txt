sure
use

would
rais

and
had
to
face
the
statist
realiti
that
onli
40
of
peopl
with
my
diseas
surviv
anoth
five
year
we
had
move
to
tokyo
onli
a

look
forward
to
exot
travel
and
experi
my
earli
death
wa
not
on
our
roadmap
but
i
ve
been
a
bright
my
whole
life
so
it
s
my
habit
to
take
whatev
come
my
way
understand
it
ration
and
make
it
a
posit
addit
to
my
life
by
focus
attent
on
what
s
most
import
my
ill
affirm
the
central
role
of
famili
and
friend
in
share
the
time
i
have
left
i
agre
with
walt
whitman
s
claim
that
onli
the
good
is
univers
becaus
dwell
on
the
bad
make
a
poor
foundat
for
a
futur
that
take
you
progress
beyond
the
past
i
tri
to
dwell
onli
on
the
univers
on
worthwhil
effort
and
regret
i
have
none
as
i
live
and
die
a
littl
each
day
ken
death
how
do
i
accept
it
well
not
with
pleasur
i
like
life
too
much
but
i
prefer
it
to
ani
form
of
etern
life
a
concept
i
find
particularli
difficult
to
get
my
head
’
round
as
a
human
be
i
can
onli
function
as
one
with
a
brain
and
bodi
that
won
t
work
anywher
els
to
be
happi
in
heaven
wherev
and
whatev
that
may
be
i
would
have
to
be
chang
and
becom
someth
els
no
longer
me
possibl
i
suppos
if
there
were
a
god
to
effect
the
transform
but
i
don
t
fanci
it
i
don
t
like
the
idea
of
paradis
no
difficulti
to
be
face
no
challeng
to
be
overcom
noth
to
lack
no
sick
to
be
cure
a
worm
could
be
happi
i
suppos
live
forev
in
a
pot
of
cool
moist
earth
to
be
happi
in
paradis
i
would
have
to
be
chang
into
someth
similar
no
thank
you
so
i
see
my
life
as
have
an
end
as
well
as
a
begin
as
a
pictur
or
a
sculptur
ha
it
limit
in
space
so
a
poem
a
piec
of
music
a
stori
or
a
life
ha
it
limit
in
time
how
strang
it
would
be
if
it
were
not
so
val
i
don
t
want
to
die
like
a
child
who
doesn
t
want
to
go
to
bed
i
don
t
want
to
miss
out
on
what
will
happen
after
i
m
gone
but
i
will
die
i
deal
with
that
disappoint
fact
by
take
care
of
myself
and
take
care
with
my
time
i
tri
to
stay
healthi
and
safe
i
drive
care
and
exercis
but
at
best
precaut
onli
postpon
the
inevit
so
i
don
t
invest
too
heavili
in
them
i
prefer
to
spend
my
limit
time
do
thing
that
are
import
to
me
i
m
thrill
by
thing
i
learn
so
i
read
engag
in
stimul
convers
and
travel
i
find
great
satisfact
in
creativ
activ
so
i
take
photograph
and
write
natur
beauti
refresh
and
renew
me
so
i
spend
time
outdoor
take
hike
and
photograph
natur
i
am
griev
that
most
peopl
endur
live
of

more
hardship
and
suffer
than
mine
so
i
contribut
to
and
particip
in
charit
activ
i
m
encourag
and
nurtur
by
my
relationship
so
i
talk
joke
play
game
and
share
meal
with
my
famili
and

know
that
my

is
finit
i
tri
to

the
idea
of

is
one
that
i
find
both
amus
and
conceit
amus
becaus
a
mortal
creatur
with
experi
of
less
than
a
centuri
of

can
not
comprehend
what
‘

what
we

when

go

joan
i
think
that

speci
endow
with
the
capac
to
contempl
it
own
demis
thi
exist
becaus
of
the
evolut
of

that
is
the
down
side
of

self
awar
is
that
we
inher
becom
awar
of
our

demis
or
death
awar
peopl
deal
with
it
in
veri
differ
way
rang
from
a
belief
in
a
supernatur
chaperon
to
the
heaven
to
dirt
dust
i
person
think
that
a
concept
of
a
naturalist
reincarn
is
the
healthiest
in
other
word
we
are
part
of
natur
carbon
and
all
that
and
our
demis
is
like
that
of
everi
other
speci
on
thi
planet
we
all
face
the
same
reincarn
futur
we
die
and
feed
the
earth
we
decompos
and
make
anew
the
natur
wonder
of
the
world
thi
is
not
as
pretti
as
the
religi
world
view
of
reincarn
where
one
join
their
long
lost
famili
member
in
a
heavenli
world
of
angel
and
god
and
spirit
or
is
it
by
accept
your

had
a
privileg
enough
life
that
i
consid
the

of

unaccept

so
i
think
it
quit
ridicul
to
exacerb
it
with

read
an

henc
i

then
write

then
mass

social

artifici
intellig
and
i
envis
soon
enough
through

i
guess
the
onli
thing
to
regret
is
that
the
arriv
of
artifici
conscious
ha
been
delay
by
at
least
half
a
millennium
through
the
dark

so
that
we

directli
into

of
such
peopl
as
spinoza
newton

i

to

never

after

hang
around

forum
i
feel
the
need
to
address
some
common
misunderstand
about
the
structur
and
purpos
of
the
bright

if
you
re
accustom
to
think
of
activ
strictli
in

of

organ
like
american
atheist
or
the
british
humanist
associ
then
the
bright
movement
may
have
some
counterintuit
featur
that
need
explain
think
again
the
bright
movement
it
is
not
an
organ
the
bright
movement
is
a
social
action
constitu
distinguish
by
peopl
who
fit
the
definit
of
the
noun
bright
for
social

think
polit
activ
not
philosoph
debat
for
constitu
think
that
hitherto
voiceless
group
too
larg
and
divers
to
fit
in
ani
one
tradit
organ
of
non
godfear
peopl
who
if
they
appear
as
a
strong
line
item
in
everi
polit
poll
might
have
swung
some
veri
close
elect
when
think
of
the
bright
movement
one
should
regard
it
as
be
analog
to
phrase
like
peac
movement
or
conserv
movement
or
labor
movement
each
kind
of
movement
may
have
leader
and
those
leader
may
run
organ
or
parti
but
they
do
not
lead
the
whole
movement
in
an
authorit
way
just
as
neither
margaret
thatcher
nor
georg
w
bush
lead
or
speak
for
all
conserv
no
matter
what
they
may
have
told
us
the
director
of
the
bright
net
who
coin
the
term
bright
and
it
definit
do
not
and
cannot
claim
to
speak
for
all
who
are
engag
in
the
movement
bright
they
recogn
the
distinct
between
lead
a
membership
organ
and
be
leader
within
a
movement
by
scrupul
refus
to
do
so
to
illustr
thi
point
consid
that
an
activist
membership
organ
typic
ha
a
board
of
director
a
legisl
committe
or
some
other
elect
or
appoint
bodi
that
decid
an
advocaci
agenda
and
which
empow
it
leadership
to
speak
on
behalf
of
all
member
by
promot
legisl
endors
politician
by
purchas
advertis
and
so
on
the
bright
movement
by
contrast
doesn
t
have
such
committe
and
organ
for
the
same
reason
that
conserv
and
liber
don
t
have
a
singl
bodi
empow
to
speak
for
all
conserv
or
all
liber
at
the
movement
level
it
s
simpli
not
structur
that
way
the
bright
net
as
contrast
with
the
movement
it
is
a
non
profit
educ
organ
it
s
crucial
to
understand
that
the
bright
net
doe
not
govern
the
bright
movement
rather
it
is
a
bootstrap
devic
for
launch
the
bright
movement
and
encourag
it
to
self
organ
by
analog
one
could
say
the
bright
net
is
like
the
ignit
and
electr
system
in
a
car
it
doesn
t
steer
the
car
or
make
it
go
but
it
provid
an
initi
spark
and
help
the

togeth
in
more
practic
term
the
bright

’
s
mission
is
strictli
limit
to

the
bright

by
provid
the

maintain

so
on

on
how
to
use
it
to
advanc
the
broad
aim
of
the
overal
endeavor
who
speak

one
consequ
of
thi
structur
is
that
the
bright

cannot
speak

the

on

if

the

have
poll
the
regist
bright
to
come
up
with
a
quantiti
of
support
for

precis
becaus
they
do
not
presum
to

for

thi
is
whi
you
probabl
won
’
t
see
the

’
net
unilater
endors
anoth
organ
in
the
name
of
the
bright

as
a
whole
—
such
endors
would
have
to
be
qualifi
somehow
“
x
number
of
bright
endors
y
just
as
it
would
make
no
sens
to
say
all
american
liber
endors
the

prefer
the

it

as
far
as
bright
themselv
speak
out
on

take
posit
and
voic
their
opinion
they
do
so
as
bright
—
that
is
not
on
behalf
of
other
bright
or
for
the
movement
as
a
whole
but
as
individu
who
have
a
naturalist
worldview
a
tool
for
bright
most
peopl
seem
to
understand
the
first
half
of
the
bright
meme
that
rationalist
freethink
atheist
agnost
humanist
and
other
nonreligi
folk
must
come
out
and
be
seen
as
present
a
unit
front
to
promot
the
naturalist
worldview
in
societi
and
to
resist
the
forc
of
theocraci
and
unreason
that
threaten
modern
civil
but
the
second
often
overlook
half
of
the
meme
is
thi
a
particip
in
the
bright
movement
should
see
the
bright
net
as
a
tool
not
an
author
like
ani
good
tool
it
come
with
some
instruct
but
it
doesn
t
tell
the
user
what
to
build
but
how
do
bright
build
anyth
without
a
central
hierarchi
well
i
think
one
of
the
idea
here
is
that
nobodi
realli
know
quit
how
best
to
spread
a
meme
except
mayb
cigarett
and
liquor
manufactur
and
nobodi
—
especi
independ
thinker
—
want
such
a
thing
shove
at
them
but
the
director
of
the
bright
net
have
some
idea
about
how
it
should
be
done
to
make
sure
that
the
same
old
tactic
don
t
just
get
repeat
under
a
new
name
so
they
ve
laid
out
definit
and
principl
and
explan
and
even
commun
guidelin
these
are
the
instruct
that
come
with
the
tool
the
bright

the
gist
of
the
meme
for
those
of
us
who
alreadi
call
ourselv
atheist

if

can
