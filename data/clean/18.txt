the

open
today
29
juli
2015
here
in
franc
and
i
saw
the
second
show
here
where
i
live
the
small
town
of
paimpol
there
were
perhap
30
peopl
altogeth
in
attend
i
could
hear
that
the
few
children
among
them
were
bore
so
first
comment
1
thi
is
not
a
movi
for
small
children
it
won
t
interest
them
2
if
you
are
expect
a
video
reproduct
of
st
exupéri
s
stori
you
will
be
veri
disappoint
it
s
in
thi
movi
but
it
onli
compris
a
small
part
of
it
most
of
the
movi
is
a
frame
for
that
tale
the
stori
of
a
small
girl
who
meet
an
elderli
aviat
who
tell
her
in
bit
and
piec
the
stori
of
hi
encount
mani
year
befor
with
the
littl
princ
if
you
go
expect
just
what
you
know
from
st
exupéri
s
stori
most
of
thi
movi
will
therefor
be
an
annoy
to
you
it
took
me
awhil
to
accept
the
frame
stori
it
s
fairli
banal
fairli
hollywood
nowher
near
the
origin
of
st
exupéri
s
remark
tale
but
if
you
let
yourself
go
with
it
it
ha
an
appeal
over
time
the
part
devot
to
st
exupéri
s
origin
tale
is
the
best
as
far
as
i
m
concern
we
also
see
the
princ
as
an
adult
veri
chang
that
came
as
a
shock
at
first
to
me
but
again
i
let
myself
go
with
it
and
it
had
a
certain
fairli
obviou
interest
thi
is
not
a
great
movi
ernest
and
célestin
is
a
thousand
time
better
but
it
s
worth
see
again
howev
thi
is
not
a
movi
for
littl
children
they
will
be

narrat
thi

is
about
an

wa
fine
fuse
between
the

most
essenti
storylin
for

were
enforc
by
their
parent
to
mechan
life
with
less
time
to
play
out
and
make
their

friend
especi
as
they
were
lack
the
creativ
to
make
up
their

fiction
world
with
their
toy
like
the

centuri
ago
were
it
might
psycholog
affect

anim
is
under
estim
perhap
becaus
we
tend
to
be
afraid
of
what
we
do
not
understand
i
have
seen
a
lot
of
film
done
a
lot
of
review
and
thought
i
had
seen
it
all
i
wa
wrong
first
i
had
not
read
the
book
prior
to
see
thi
film
nor
had
i
seen
the
earlier
screen
version
no
matter
i
wa
transfix
and
stun
i
wa
still
sit
there
when
the
final
credit
roll
which
is
realli
a
feat
becaus
the
credit
roll
for
10
minut
after
the
word
fin
the
end
roll
if
you
miss
the
credit
you
miss
the
turn
around
song
which
itself
could
be
highlight
of
one
of
the
most
incred
music
score
in
one
of
the
most
incred
movi
ever
when
comput
were
first
be
marri
to
anim
a
marriag
made
in
heaven
i
think
i
recal
an
interview
with
a
senior
anim
who
confid
that
when
the
day
came
that
they
could
get
the
eye
right
they
would
have
reach
the
pinnacl
of
their
craft
that
day
ha
arriv
thi
movi
is
the
herald
watch
the
eye
in
thi
film
i
felt
as
though
i
wa
watch
real
peopl
doe
that
make
me
sound
daft
i
hope
not
there
is
one
scene
where
the
littl
girl
watch
the
aviat
go
to
the
hospit
in
the
rain
she
is
at
the
same
time
transfix
with
sad
and
soak
wet
the

i
could
predict
the
movi
end
by
the
first
few
minut
or
so
and
i
told
my
wife
okay
let
s
see
if
it
can
still
be
entertain
on
the
detail
oh
boy
i
may
never
been
so
glad
to
be
so
wrong
i
mean
of
cours
i
wa
hope
for
it
to
be
good
but
i
wa
expect
veri
veri
littl
of
it
most
anim
i
ve
been
watch
in
the
past
2
year
or
so
includ
pixar
s
have
not
be
abl
to
move
me
at
all
at
all
and
imdb
score
wa
just
below
what
i
d
expect
from
a
good
one
okay
insid
out
wa
an
except
great
and
cute
mayb
my
hope
for
that
one
were
too
high
but
i
wa
hope
for
a
better
neural
represent
there
and
it
had
some
weak
scienc
behind
it
don
t
take
my
or
steve
novella
s
word
for
it
do
your
homework
i
would
argu
it
is
even
harm
becaus
it
will
certainli
creat
new
bad
myth
about
the
mind
and
the
brain
anyway
littl
princ
at
least
isn
t
about
scienc
becaus
els
they
d
get
it
wrong
at
veri
least
on
the
lucid
dream
there
but
it
s
perfectli
done
perfectli
everi
littl
detail
right
near
the
begin
the
girl
get
a
new
friend
and
start
to
wonder
how
hi
stori
could
be
possibl
while
she
is
think
the
wind
in
the
background
is
move
engin
that
s
art
and
scienc
even
if
onli
subconsci
even
if
the
symbol
there
is
exquisit
i
have
watch
a
few
french
movi
i
do
know
a
littl
about
the
cultur
there
i
ve
tour
through
franc
more
than
ani
other
european
countri
in
my
2013
tour
i
haven
t
seen
anyth
like
thi
befor
mayb
i
will
need
to
take
my
french
class
back
again
eventu
here
let
me
tell
you
about
2
math
formula
that
appear
in
there
not
the
onli
one
the
first
book
she
doe
open
is
about
math
probabl
algebra
but
in
french
sorri
for
a
few
second
first
one
is
about
analyt
geometri
and
got
an
escher
pictur
in
it
now
in
brazil
we
don
t
learn
ani
of
that
in
school
not
even
calculu
but
i
ve
gone
to
first
year
of
statist
and
1
got
semest
of
math
in
there
that
shoot
is
complex
the
onli
thing
i
can
say
about
the
first
pictur
is
she
got
a
great
compress
write
and
think
there
thi
to
me
mean
more
than
anyth
that
whoever
wrote
the
script
i
haven
t
read
the
book
wa
an
avid
math
enthusiast
like
myself
at
veri
least
on
the
second
one
howev
she
get
on
to
some
calculu
which
to
me
wa
one
of
the
funnest
part
in
school
after
geometri
and
i
didn
t
realli
enjoy
math
in
colleg
math
wa
alway
my
favorit
topic
in
school
and
that
s
a
simpl
3rd
degre
express
all
i
can
say
is
it
s
not
be
properli
resolv
at
first
sight
but
i
bet
there
s
a
mean
there
i
just
can
t
see
yet
thi
is
how
thi
movi
wa
made
fill
with
tini
littl
detail
at
everi
singl
second
i
m
veri
good
at
math
and
at
count
but
i
can
t
even
understand
what
the
6
year
old
is
do
in
her
book
there
and
those
are
imag
that
just
don
t
matter
to
the
plot
or
for
anyth
els
realli
they
re
there
on
their
own
i
ll
make
a
real
bold
guess
here
but
i
think
thi
have

i
have
read
thi
marvel
book
mani
time
first
as
a
naiv
school
boy
and
year
later
as
a
grown
up
have
enjoy
read
it
in
4
languag
so
i
wa
excit
to
see
thi
new
anim
i
watch
it
have
in
mind
to
stay
open
mind
henc
the
first
half
wa
somehow
accept
the
stori
of
a
littl
girl
with
st
exuperi
in
hi
last
day
mix
with
part
from
the
origin
stori
of
the
book
i
tri
to
understand
the
director
s
viewpoint
that
you
can
t
present
thi
classic
as
it
is
for
today
s
audienc
well
ye
and
no
the
part
tell
the
origin
stori
as
anim
visual
color
textur
are
beauti
and
touch
inde
bravo
but
the
second
half
littl
princ
in
the
21
centuri
wa
rather
averag
and
the
end
more
or
less
disappoint
i
think
there
are
work
of
music
literatur
art
which
are
to
be
reinterpret
veri
care
or
better
be
left
in
their
pure
origin
form
i
feel
exuperi
s
book
is
in
that
categori
if
you
valu
the
book
as
a
treasur
of
human
literatur
it
s
probabl
better
not
to
watch
thi
anim
if
you
don
t
know
the
book
you
may
enjoy
thi
anim
it
is
not
bad
but
it
is
not
a
success
interpret
of
the
littl
princ
at
least
they
could
have
the
sensit
of
not
use

first
of
all
i
never
read
the
book
even
though
i
heard
about
the
littl
princ
sinc
i
wa
just
a
littl
kid
it
s
a
well
known
classic
literatur
after
all
so
when
i
hear
the
book
wa
made
into
a
movi
i
got
so
excit
and
couldn
t
wait
to
watch
it
after
i
watch
it
i
do
not
regret
it
at
all
it
wa
a
good
movi
and
make
me
want
to
read
the
book
version
i
read
some
of
the
review
that
tell
me
that
thi
movi
wa
realli
differ
from
the
book
version
so
it
intrigu
my
curios
my
review
is
as
an
outsid
who
doesn
t
know
it
real
stori
so
i
won
t
compar
the
movi
version
with
the
book
version
for
the
movi
version
i
guess
i
pretti
much
like
it
i
agre
that
thi
movi
is
not
suitabl
for
kid
sinc
kid
will
find
it
bore
the
pace
of
the
movi
is
kinda
slow
also
it
kind
of
hard
to
understand
for
kid
the
visual
itself
went
so
well
and
beauti
finish
with
the
combin
of
stop
motion
and
3d
anim
well
from
my
point
of
view
i
think
the
stori
itself
tri
to
teach
us
about
life
happi
sad
and
how
to
grow
up
without
forget
who
we
are
all
those
kind
of
valuabl
thing
that
we
tend
to
forget
as
we
grown
up
and
be
part
of
the
adult
world
i
highli
recommend
thi
movi
for
those
who
do
not
read
the
novel
yet
and
those
who
like
philosoph
thing
wrap
in
a
beauti
