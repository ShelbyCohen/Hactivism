i
m
sure
use
it
the
right
way
in
the
right
sentenc
would
rais
the

even
start

also
embarrass
i
use

earli
death
wa
not
on
our
roadmap
but
i
ve
been
a
bright
my
whole
life
so
it
s
my
habit
to
take
whatev
come
my
way
understand
it
ration
and
make
it
a
posit
addit
to
my
life
by
focus
attent
on
what
s
most
import
my
ill
affirm
the
central

ken
death
how
do
i
accept
it
well
not
with
pleasur
i
like
life
too
much
but
i
prefer
it
to
ani
form
of
etern
life
a
concept
i
find
particularli
difficult
to
get
my
head
’
round
as
a
human
be
i
can
onli
function
as
one
with
a
brain
and
bodi
that
won

work
anywher
els
to
be

wherev
and
whatev
that

and
becom
someth
els
no

me
possibl
i
suppos
if
there
were
a
god
to
effect
the
transform
but
i
don
t
fanci
it
i
don
t
like
the
idea
of
paradis
no
difficulti
to
be
face
no
challeng
to
be
overcom
noth
to
lack
no
sick
to

cool
moist
earth
to
be
happi
in
paradis
i
would
have
to
be
chang
into
someth
similar
no
thank
you
so
i
see
my
life
as
have
an
end
as
well
as
a
begin
as
a
pictur
or
a
sculptur
ha
it
limit
in

so
a

a
piec
of

a

or
a
life
ha
it
limit
in

how
strang
it
would
be
if
it
were
not
so
val
i
don

want
to
die
like
a

who
doesn
t
want
to
go
to

i
don
t
want
to
miss
out
on
what
will
happen
after

i
deal
with
that
disappoint
fact
by
take

of
myself
and
take
care
with
my
time
i
tri
to
stay
healthi
and
safe
i
drive

and
exercis
but
at
best
precaut
onli
postpon

inevit
so
i
don
t
invest
too
heavili
in
them
i
prefer
to
spend
my
limit
time
do
thing
that
are
import
to
me
i
m
thrill
by
thing
i
learn
so
i
read

hi
messag
wa
just
do
what

isn

it
better
to
take
care
of
what
matter
even
if
you
don

we
don

t
know
what
realli
“

”
in
life
we
must
do
what
we
think
matter
most
for
ourselv
for
other
here
and
now
and
for
those
who
come
after
mayb
our
name
will
live
on
more
like
we
’
ll
be
forgotten
but
like
a
leaf
fall
in
the
forest
and
feed
new
life
what
we
did
when
we
were
aliv
will
affect
life
go
forward
joan
i
think
that
human
are
the
onli
speci
endow
with
the
capac
to
contempl
it
own
demis
thi
exist
becaus
of
the
evolut
of
self
awar
that
is
the
down
side
of
be
self
awar
is
that
we
inher
becom
awar
of
our
own
demis
or
death
awar
peopl
deal
with
it
in
veri
differ
way
rang
from
a
belief
in
a
supernatur
chaperon
to
the
heaven
to
dirt
dust
i
person
think
that
a
concept
of
a
naturalist
reincarn
is
the
healthiest
in
other
word
we
are
part
of
natur
carbon
and
all
that
and
our
demis
is
like
that
of
everi
other
speci
on
thi
planet
we
all
face
the
same
reincarn
futur
we
die
and
feed
the
earth
we
decompos
and
make
anew
the
natur
wonder
of
the
world
thi
is
not
as
pretti
as
the
religi
world
view
of
reincarn
where
one
join
their
long
lost
famili
member
in
a
heavenli
world
of
angel
and
god
and
spirit
or
is
it
by
accept

life
that

i
envis
soon
enough
through

i
guess
the
onli
thing
to
regret
is
that
the
arriv
of
artifici
conscious
ha
been
delay
by
at
least
half
a
millennium
through
the
dark

so
that
