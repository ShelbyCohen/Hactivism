i
didn
t
want
to
put
out

the
perfect
rite
of

the
anxieti
of
what

s
group
songwrit
session
often
with

craftsmen
who
polish
the

chip
at
it
hone
it
and
go
for
that
it
s
heaven
the
more
vulner
the

he
learn
the
better
the
one
subject
that
hit

from
keith
richard
to
put
chuck
berri
into
word
that
is
a
task
if
i
flip
the
coin
and
wonder
how
the
fuck
chuck
berri
react
to
me
when
he
first
heard
my
feebl
effort
to
spread
hi
groov
my
guess
is
a
disdain
chuckl
and
then
a
gleam
as
he
imagin
the
royalti
roll
in
then
a
realiz
that
hi
music
wa
far
more
import
than
he
had
ever
imagin
he
did
thank
me
for
that
and
let
’
s
face
it
chuck
had
imagin
just
check
the
song
all
is
reveal
on
“

“

“

goe
on
and
on
“

”
“

”
or
the
heartbreak
“

”
you
have
to
hear
the
origin
record
to
get
the
whole
pictur
let
us
make
no

about
him

hi
own
root
went
wide

deep
even
back
via
loui
jordan
to
the
big
band
but
we
’
re
talk
about
a
complic
and
thought
man
here
listen
to
“
no

”
the
incred
“

a
song

john

there

for
me
the
world
went
from
black
to

to
gloriou

there
wa
no

in
