state
in

we
ll
break
into
thing
we
ll
disrupt
thing
we
ll
destroy
thing
thi
is
the
origin
mean
of
the
word
hacker
and
thi
is
a
desir
to
learn
more
about
thing
to
almost
liber
knowledg
mayb
it
lot
stand
in
the
way
mayb
they
don
t
but
the
quest
is
not
a
malici
one
it
s
do
what
they
think
is
best
for
societi
cornish
and
aaron
swartz
may
not
have
been
a
household
name
but
there
are
some
other
free
cultur
adher
out
there
who
are
well
known
for
be
veri
aggress
such
as
wikileak
and
the
hacker
group
anonym
right
mccullagh
that
s
right
and
those
are
kind
of
the
point
end
of
the
free
cultur
movement
but
there
are
folk
who
are
much
more
mainstream
i
mean
larri
lessig
the
author
and
the
law
professor
would
be
one
of
them
richard
stallman
who
gave
birth
to
the
term
free
softwar
who
coin
the
term
free
as
in
freedom
not
free
as
in
no
cost
there
s
a
littl
bit
might
have
that
as
well
and
so
there
are
thi
is
the
culmin
of
decad
of
work
by
a
lot
of
folk
straddl
the
line
between
hackerdom
and
law
and
polit
cornish
and
aaron
swartz
wa
a
sort
of
lead
advoc
and
voic
for
thi
in
2008
swartz
wrote
someth
he
call
the
guerilla
open
access
manifesto
and
in
it
he
wa
address
student
librarian
and
scientist
in
thi
way
he
said
you
get
to
feed
at
thi
banquet
of
knowledg
while
the
rest
of
the
world
is
lock
out
but
you
need
not
inde
moral
you
cannot
keep
thi
privileg
for
yourselv
you
have
a
duti
to
share
it
with
the
world
and
he
saw
thi
caus
as
civil
disobedi
essenti
right
mccullagh
i
think
that
s
right
and
that
s
what
he
did
when
tri
to
do
it
what
in
hi
term
would
have
been
to
liber
knowledg
liber
data
especi
data
that
taxpay
have
alreadi
paid
for
he
download
a
larg
percentag
of
feder
court
decis
that
are
avail
for
a
fee
through
the
pacer
feder
court
websit
with
the
intent
to
make
those
avail
to
the
public
at
no
cost
instead
of
charg
10
cent
a
page
which
is
what
the
feder
court
like
to
do
which
is
well
abov
what
they
need
to
do
to
break
even
and
he
wa
tri
the
same
thing
thi
wa
what
he
wa
accus
of
do
when
he
wa
at
harvard
and
set
up
a
comput
allegedli
in
a
wire
closet
at
mit
to
download
larg
portion
of
the
jstor
databas
where
academ
publish
their
articl
hi
idea
is
that
these
should
be
avail
to
the
public
cornish
and
as
you
mention
becaus
of
hi
action
swartz
wa
about
to
be
the
subject
of
a
feder
trial
he
wa
face
up
to
35
year
in
prison
thi
realli
put
him
at
the
center
of
thi
debat
about
inform
and
free
inform
but
who
wa
win
that
debat
i
mean
wa
it
the
hacktivist
wa
it
the
compani
and
the
govern
mccullagh
the
debat
ha
been
go
on
for
i
can
think
offhand
at
least
15
year
but
it
realli
depend
it
s
a
battl
of
offens
and
defens
the
high
water
mark
perhap
for
the
open
cultur
movement
wa
when
they
defeat
the
stop
onlin
piraci
act
last
year
it
wa
just
a
year
ago
in
fact
next
week
you
had
corpor
come
togeth
with
activist
and
academ
say
thi
bill
that
hollywood
want
that
would
forc
allegedli
infring
copyright
infring

to
disappear
from
the
internet
that
went
too
far
and
they
won
hollywood
wa
put
on
the
defens
the
