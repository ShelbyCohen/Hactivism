state
in

who
and
how
and
what
gave
birth
to
the
free

movement
mccullagh
the
free
cultur
movement
realli
stem
out
of
a
hacker
cultur
from
a
gener
or
more
ago
and
i
m
not
talk
hacker
cultur
as
in
we
ll
break
into
thing
we
ll
disrupt
thing
we
ll
destroy
thing
thi
is
the
origin
mean
of
the
word
hacker
and
thi
is
a
desir
to
learn
more
about
thing
to
almost
liber
knowledg
mayb
it
lot
stand
in
the
way
mayb
they
don
t
but
the
quest
is
not
a
malici
one
it
s
do
what
they
think
is
best
for
societi
cornish
and
aaron
swartz
may
not
have
been
a
household
name
but
there
are
some
other
free

adher
out
there
who
are
well
known
for
be
veri
aggress
such
as
wikileak
and
the
hacker
group
anonym
right
mccullagh
that
s
right
and
those
are
kind
of
the
point
end
of
the
free
cultur
movement
but
there
are
folk
who
are
much
more
mainstream
i
mean
larri
lessig
the
author
and
the
law
professor
would
be
one
of
them
richard
stallman
who
gave
birth
to
the
term

softwar
who
coin
the
term
free
as
in
freedom
not
free
as
in
no
cost
there
s
a
littl
bit
might
have
that
as
well
and
so
there
are
thi
is
the
culmin
of
decad
of
work
by
a
lot
of
folk
straddl
the
line
between
hackerdom
and

and
he
saw
thi

right
mccullagh
i
think
that
s
right
and
that
s
what
he
did
when
tri
to

it
what
in

would
have
been
to

data
that

decis
that
are

through

websit
with
the
intent
to
make
those
avail

public
at
no

instead
of
charg
10
cent
a

which
is
what
the
feder
court
like
to
do
which
is
well
abov
what
they
need
to
do
to
break
even
and
he
wa
tri
the
same
thing
thi
wa
what
he
wa
accus
of
do
when
he
wa
at
harvard
and
set
up
a

in

closet
at

to

larg
portion
of

where
academ

hi
idea
is
that
these
should
be
avail

cornish
and
as
you

becaus
of
hi
action
swartz
wa
about

trial
he
wa
face
up
to
35
year

thi
realli
put
him
at
the
center
of
thi
debat
about
inform
and
free
inform
but
who
wa
win
that
debat
i
mean
wa
it
the
hacktivist
wa
it

compani
and
the
govern
mccullagh
the

ha
been
go
on
for
i
can
think
offhand
at

15

we
have
the
impress
most
hack
in

until

have
been
done
by
‘

peopl
who
execut

as
a
warn

secur

we
come
to
thi
conclus

the
fact
that
when

would
have
been
done

a

have

we
therefor
suggest
to
make
a
clear
differ
between
a
hack
done
becaus
of
the
hack
not
to
gain
person
profit
and
peopl
who
breach

a
deed
that
can
be
