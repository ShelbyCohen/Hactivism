–
wa
the
origin
sin
the
origin
caus
of
thi
financi

with
the
privat

come
the
dispossess
of
peopl
from
their
land
which
wa
held
in

by
commun
with
the

come
the
privat
of
everyth
els
becaus
onc
land
can
be

almost
anyth
els
can
eventu
be
bought
and
sold
as
the
poor
of
south
africa
we
know
thi
becaus
we
live
it
coloni
and
apartheid
dispossess
us
of
our
land
and
gave
it
to
white
to
be
bought
and
sold
for
profit
when
apartheid
as
a
systemat
racial
instrument
end
in
1994
we
did
not
get
our
land
back
some
black
are
now
abl
to
own
land
as
long
as
they
have
the
money
to
do
so
but
as
the
poor
live
in
council
home
rent
flat
or
live
in
the
shack
we
becam
even
more
vulner
to
the
properti
market
it
is
chill
to
hear
mani
peopl
today
speak
with
nostalgia
about
how
it
wa
better
dure
apartheid
–
as
if
it
wa
not
apartheid
that
stole
their
land
in
the
first
place
but
in
an
obscur
way
it
make
sens
back
then
in
the
citi
there
wa
less
competit
for
land
and
hous
becaus
mani
of
us
were
kept
in
the
bantustan
by
a
combin
of
forc
and
econom
compuls
such
as
subsid
rural
factori
the
inform
settlement
in
the
citi
were
smaller
and
land
less
scarc
but
in
the
new
south
africa
what
some
call
post
apartheid
south
africa
and
other
call
neoliber
south
africa
the
elit
have
decid
it
is
everi
man
–
or
woman
or

for
him
or

and
thu
the
poor
end
up

as
well
as
with
themselv
the

in

there
is
veri
littl
regul
of
thi
and
where
there
is
regul
corrupt
and
authoritarian
govern
offici
get
around
it
in
a
heartbeat
peopl
say
that
we
have
the
best
constitut
in
the
world
–
but
what
kind
of
constitut
enshrin
the
pursuit
of
profit
abov
anyth
els
they
claim
it
wa
written
for
us
that
may
be
but
it
obvious
wa
not
written
by
us
–
the
poor
so
the
recent
realiz
that
there
is
a
financi
crisi
in
the
us
we
think
the
crisi
ha
been
there
a
long
time
but
wa
hidden
by
economist
remind
us
of
where
we
ourselv
stand
while
our
neoliber
govern

40
percent

while
mandela

and
the
economi
grew
poor
south
african
had
their
home
stolen
right
from
under
them
for
our
entir
live
we
have
been
live
in
a
depress
and
at
the
center
of
thi
crisi
is
land
and
hous
as
the
poor
we
gave
the
african
nation
congress
govern
five
year
to
at
least
make
some
inroad
toward
redistribut
but
instead
the
land
and
hous
crisi
ha
gotten
wors
inequ
greater
and
we
are
more
vulner
than
ever
so
in
1999

and
the
like
we
have
been

and
small

but
our
commun
are
also
fight
two
larger
battl
the
first
is
embodi
in
the
declar
we
make
to
the
outsid
world
we
may
be
poor
but
we
are
not
stupid
we
may
be
poor
but
we
can
still
think
noth
for
us
without
us
talk
to
us
not
about
us
we
are
fight
for
democraci
the
right
to
be
heard
and
the
right
to
be
in
control
of
our
own
commun
and
our
own
societi
thi
mean
that
govern
offici
and
polit
parti
should
stop
tell
us
what
we
want
we
know
what
we
want
thi
mean
that
ngo
and
develop
“
expert
”
should
stop
workshop
us
on
“
world
renown
”
solut
at
the
expens
of
our
own
homegrown
knowledg
thi
mean
we
refus
to
be
a
“
stakehold
”
and
have
our
voic
manag
and
diminish
by
those
who
count
in
the
2004
nation
elect
and
again
in
thi
year
’
s
elect
we
have
declar
“
no
land
no
hous
no
vote
”
thi
is
not
becaus
we
are
against
democraci
but
becaus
we
are
against
vote
for
elit
and
for
politician
who
promis
us
the
whole
world
everi
five
year
and
when
they
get
elect
steal
the
littl
we
have
for
themselv
elect
are
a
chanc
for
those
in
power
to
consolid
it
we
believ
thi
is
not
onli
a
problem
of
corrupt
but
also
a
structur
problem
that
give
individu
and
polit
parti
the
author
to
make
decis
for
us
we
reject
that
and
we
reject
vote
for
it
second
while
our
action
may
seem
like
a
demand
for
welfar
couch
in
a
demand
for
hous

water
they
are
actual
a
demand
to

the
commodif

land
labour
and

we
take
action
to
get
land

and
also
to
prevent
bank
from
steal
our
land

when
a
famili
get

put
them

last
year
we
put

when

we
put
it
back

2001
we
were
abl
to
get
the
citi
of
cape
town
to
declar
a
two
month
moratorium

we
break

not

we
never
