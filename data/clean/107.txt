meant
by
thi
is
notion
that
who
a
person
sleep
with
how
they
dress
and
how
they
wear
their

is
a
polit
statement
there
were
some
individu
within
the
movement
that
felt
that
in
order
to
be
a
true
feminist
that
they
had
to
refus
to
sleep
with
men

with
thi
notion
we
see
an
idea
that
is

more
radic

there
were
mani

point
to

success
they
felt
that
one
success
wa
the
establish
of

gave

even
though
it
ha
yet
to
be
pass
it
ha
gotten
through

remnant
of
it

success
of

although
titl

is
far
from
perfect
and

continu
to
thi
day
it
is
still
consid
success
nonetheless
if
we
analyz
the
histori

we
do
see
that
they
have
come
a
long

howev
as
is
the
case
in

there
is
no

furiou
about

she
felt
that
action

as

would
prevent

desir
friedan
also
state
that
she
didn

want
peopl
to

the
fact
wa
howev
that
a
great

of
the
younger
peopl
that
were
particip

were
inde

in

almost
result
in

more
conserv
member
of
the
organ
began
expel
the
more

it
wa
at
thi
point
that
lesbian

began
to
pursu
their

for

“

and
what
is

meant
by
thi
is
notion
that
who
a
person
sleep
with
how
they
dress
and
how
they
wear
their
hair
is
a
polit
statement
there
were
some
individu
within
the
movement
that
felt
that
in
order
to
be
a
true
feminist
that
they
had
to
refus
to
sleep
with
men
but
with
thi
notion
we
see
an
idea
that
is
onli
embrac
by
the
more
radic

there
were
mani
thing
that
the

point
to
as
exampl
of
their
success
they
felt
that
one
success
wa
the
establish
of

which
gave

even
though
it

pass
it
ha
gotten
through

remnant
of
it

success
of

is

it

nonetheless
if

there
is
no

and
threw
them
into

friedan
wa
furiou
about
these

she
felt
that
action
such
as

would
prevent
peopl
from
take

friedan

the

desir
friedan
also
state
that
she
didn
t
want
peopl
to
think
that
now
wa
just
a

of

the
fact
wa
howev
that
a
great

of
the
younger
peopl
that
were
particip

were

an
inevit
split

in

almost
result
in
the
destruct
of
the
organ
more
conserv
member
of
the
organ
began
expel
the
more
radic
member
it
wa
at
thi
point
that
lesbian
women
began
to
pursu
their
own
interest
to
mani

the
creation
of

the
refrain
for
mani
wa
“
person

polit
”
and
what
is
supposedli
meant
by
thi
is
notion
that
who
a
person
sleep
with
how
they
dress
and
how
they
wear
their
hair
is
a
polit
statement
there
were
some
individu
within
the
movement
that
felt
that
in
order
to
be
a
true
feminist
that
they
had
to
refus
to
sleep
with
men
but
with
thi
notion
we
see
an
idea
that
is
onli
embrac
by
the
more
radic
and
extrem
faction
of
the
women
’

movement
there
were
mani
thing
that
the
women
’
s
movement
point
to
as
exampl
of
their
success
they
felt
that
one
success
wa
the
establish
of
roe

which
gave
women
the
right
to
choos
abort
as
an
option

wa
meant
as
a

even
though
it
ha
yet
to
be
pass
it
ha
gotten
through
both
the
hous
and
the
senat

remnant
of
it
continu

thi
day
anoth
success
of
the

be

although
titl
9
is
far
from

thi

it
is
still
consid

nonetheless
if
we
analyz
the
histori

we
do
see
that
they
have
come
a
long
way
howev
as
is
the
case
in

there
is
no
question
that
they

at
thi
point
that

and
what
is

meant
by
thi
is
notion
that
who
a
person
sleep
with
how
they
dress
and
how
they
wear
their
hair
is
a
polit
statement
there
were
some
individu
within
the
movement
that
felt
that
in
order
to
be
a
true
feminist
that
they
had
to
refus
to
sleep
with
men
but
with
thi
notion
we
see
an
idea
that
is

embrac
by

more
radic

faction
of

there
were
mani
thing
that
the

point
to
as
exampl
of
their
success
they
felt
that
one
success
wa
the
establish
of

which
gave
women
the
right
to

it
ha
gotten

success
of

is
far

it

nonetheless
if

have
come

there
is
no

and
how
they
wear
their
hair
is
a
polit
statement
there
were
some
individu
within
the
movement
that
felt
that
in
order
to
be
a
true
feminist
that
they
had
to
refus
to
sleep
with
men
but
with
thi
notion
we
see
an
idea
that
is
onli
embrac
by
the
more
radic
and
extrem
faction
of
the
women
’
s
movement
there
were
mani
thing
that
the
women
’
s
movement
point
to
as
exampl
of
their
success
they
felt
that
one
success
wa
the
establish
of
roe
vs
wade
which
gave
women
the
right
to
choos
abort
as
an
option
anoth
success
wa
the
equal

which
wa
meant
as
a
logic
extens
to
women

s

and
even
though
it
ha
yet
to
be
pass
it
ha
gotten
through
both
the
hous
and
the
senat
and
remnant
of
it
continu
to
thi
day
anoth
success
of
the
women
’
s
movement
could
be
titl
9
which
call
for
women
to
have
equal
opportun
in
colleg
sport
although
titl
9
is
far
from
perfect
and
convers
continu
to
thi
day
it
is
still
consid
success
nonetheless
if
we
analyz
the
histori
of
the
women
’
s
movement
we
do
see
that
they
have
come
a
long
way
howev
as
is
the
case
in
ani
other
polit
movement
there
is
no
question
that
they
still
have
a
long

the

they
mesh
into

the

that

conclud
that

can

so
much
of

is
hung
upon
the

of

that
the
dismantl
of
thi
structur
will
provid
the
opportun
for
make
a
more
viabl
life
for
everyon
it
is
import
to
stress
that
these
two
ethic
must
work
togeth
in
tandem
if
the
first
is
emphas
over
the
second
then
we
have
a
women
s
right
movement
not
one
of
women
s
liber
to
seek
onli
equal
given
the
current
male
bia
of
the
social
valu
is
to
assum
that
women
want
to
be
like
men
or
that
men
are
worth
emul
it
is
to
demand
that
women
be
allow
to
particip
in
societi
as
we
know
it
to
get
their
piec
of
the
pie
without
question
the
extent
to
which
that
societi
is
worth
particip
in
thi
view
is
held
by
some
but
most
feminist
today
find
it
inadequ
those
women
who
are
more
person
compat
in
what
is
consid
the
male
role
must
realiz
that
that
role
is
made
possibl
onli
by
the
exist
of
the
femal
sex
role
in
other
word
onli
by
the
subject
of
women
therefor
women
cannot
becom
equal
to
men
without
the
destruct
of
those
two
interdepend
mutual
parasit
role
the
failur
to
realiz
that
the
integr
of
the
sex
role
and
the
equal
of
the
sex
will
inevit
lead
to
basic
structur
chang
is
to
fail
to
seiz
the
opportun
to
decid
the
direct
of
those
chang
it
is
just
as
danger
to
fall
into
the
trap
of
seek
liber
without
due
concern
for
equal
thi
is
the
mistak
made
by
mani
of
the

radic
they
find
the
gener
human
condit
to
be
wretch
that
they

it
