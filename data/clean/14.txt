incom
we
believ
that
if
the
white
american
businessmen
will
not
give
full
employ
then
the
mean
of
product
should
be
taken
from
the

so
that
the

that
if

then
the
hous
and

they
call

the
time
bobbi

explain
“

see
the
white

as
the
oppressor
and
make
no
distinct
between

as
the
panther
do
the
cultur
nationalist
say
that
a
black
man
cannot
be
the
enemi
of
the
black
peopl
while
the
panther
believ
that
black
capitalist
are
exploit
and
oppressor
although
the
black

parti
believ
in

it
doe
not

the

made
a
clean
break
with
both
the

approach
they
argu
instead
that
the
econom
and
polit
root
of
racism
were
in
the
exploit
capitalist
system
and
that
the
black
struggl
must
be
a
revolutionari
movement
to
overthrow
the

in

to
achiev

but
no

improv
to
the
daili
live
of

higher
in
1966
after
more
than
a

of
struggl
than
in

32
of
black
peopl
were

of
the

realiz
that

to
address
the
fundament
econom
problem
that
peopl
face
in

they
were
the
first
independ

to
have
a

all
the
econom

”
thi
wa
the
guid
philosophi
of
the
black
panther
but
critic
to
their
develop
wa
the
knowledg
that
it
wa
not
enough
to
have
the
right
theori
that
thi
must
be
translat
into
a
concret
set
of
demand
that
peopl
can
relat
to
and
a
clear
cours
of
action
to
achiev
those
demand
and
so
the
first
task
of

and
newton
wa
to
sit
down
and
write

2
we
want
full

we
believ
that
the
feder

oblig
to

we
believ
that
if
the
white
american
businessmen
will
not
give
full
employ
then
the
mean
of

should
be
taken
from

an

even
greater

without
underestim
the
difficulti
they
cannot
entir
account
for
the
fall
of

there
are
a
number
of
factor
which
contribut
women
in
the
panthersth
role
of
women
within
the
panther
wa
an
area
with
mani
problem
at
one
point
women
compris
70
of
the
membership
of
the
organ
yet
all
the
lead
posit
were
occupi
by
men
thi
is
not
a
petti
point
becaus
it
illustr
the
differ
role
that
men
and
women
took
on
it
seem
that
mani
women
were
confin
to
secretari
administr
childcar
or
other
tradit
role
whilst
men
were
encourag
to
develop
the
polit
idea
speak
and
leadership
abil
also
some
of
the
brother
complain
that
they
were
not
take
direct
from
a
woman
at
other
time
it
wa
found
that
accus
of
be
a
counter
revolutionari
were
spread
about
a
woman
just
becaus
she
did
not
want
to
sleep
with
someon
these
problem
would
have
cut
the
panther
off
from
a
whole
layer
of
black
women
who
were
not
prepar
to
put
up
with
thi
nonsens
howev
we
have
to
see
that
sexist
attitud
were
not
uniqu
to
the
panther
–
it
is
someth
that
occur
in
all
organ
becaus
it
is
relat
to
the
oppress
natur
of
thi
societi
and
the
way
in
which
it
exploit
women
the
panther
did
take
action
against
these
attitud
but
they
did
not
fulli
succeed
–
equal
in
the
parti
wa
never
achiev
and
you
cannot
be
a
true
commun
organ
fight
the
oppress
of
societi
if
women
are
be
oppress
within
your
organ
the
membership
of
the
panther
wa
5
000
thi
seem
pretti
low
when
you
consid
all
they
achiev
but
the
reason
is
that
those
5
000
member
were
all
full
time
you
could
not
be
a
member
of
the
organ
unless
you
were
unemploy
or
prepar
to
give
up
your
job
it
is
a
sign
of
the
tremend
commit
that
the
panther
inspir
that
they
had
5
000
full
time
worker
but
they
would
definit
have
had
a
much
much
larger
membership
if
they
had
allow
student
and
peopl
who
were
work
to
join
in

they
cut
themselv
off
from
hundr
of
thousand
of
peopl
who
would
have
support
them
thi
also
set
them
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
commun
revolutionari
black

groupsat
that
point
in

there
were

they

although
they
had
some

within

union
the
panther
did
not
suffici
develop
thi
aspect
of
the
work
it
wa
of
particular
import
becaus
the
black

is
critic
in

the

one
of

thi

had
