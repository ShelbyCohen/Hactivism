cameron
state
they
were
like
oooooohkaaaaaay
–
a
three
hour
romant
epic
sure
that
s
just
what
we
want
is
there
a
littl
bit
of
termin
in
that
ani
harrier
jet
shoot
out
or

i
said
no
no
no
it

not

that
9
the
studio
wa
dubiou
about
the
idea
s
commerci
prospect
but
hope
for
a
long

cameron
convinc
fox
to
promot
the
film
base
on
the
public
afford
by
shoot
the
titan
wreck
itself
45
and
organ
sever
dive
to
the
site
over
a
period
of
two
year
41
my
pitch
on
that
had
to
be
a
littl
more
detail
said
cameron
so
i
said
look
we
ve
got
to
do
thi
whole
open
where
they
re
explor
the
titan
and
they
find
the
diamond
so
we
re
go
to
have
all
these
shot
of
the
ship
cameron
state
now
we
can
either
do
them
with
elabor
model
and
motion
control
shot
and
cg
and
all
that
which
will
cost
x
amount
of
money
–
or
we
can
spend
x
plu
30
per
cent
and
actual
go
shoot
it
at
the
real
wreck
43
the
crew
shot
at
the
real
wreck
in
the
atlant
ocean
twelv
time
in
1995
and
actual
spent
more
time
with
the
ship
than
it
passeng
at
that
depth
with
a
water
pressur
of
6
000
pound
per
squar
inch
one
small
flaw
in
the
vessel
s
superstructur
would
mean
instant
death
for
all
on
board
not
onli
were
the
dive
high
risk
but
advers
condit
prevent
cameron
from

he

descend

made
both
cameron
and

want
to
live
up
to
that
level
of
realiti
but
there
wa
anoth
level
of
reaction
come
away
from
the
real
wreck
which
wa
that
it
wasn
t
just
a
stori
it
wasn
t
just
a
drama
he
said
it
wa
an
event
that
happen
to
real
peopl
who
realli
die
work
around
the
wreck
for
so
much
time
you
get
such
a
strong
sens
of
the
profound
sad
and
injustic
of
it
and
the
messag
of
it
cameron
state
you
think
there
probabl
aren
t
go
to
be
mani
filmmak
who
go
to
titan
there
may
never
be
anoth
one
–
mayb
a
documentarian
due
to
thi
he
felt
a
great
mantl
of
respons
to
convey
the
emot
messag
of
it
–
to
do
that
part
of
it
right
too
18
after
film
the
underwat
shot
cameron
began
write
the
screenplay
45
he
want
to
honor
the
peopl
who
die
dure
the
sink
so
he
spent
six
month
research
all
of
the
titan
s
crew
and
passeng
41
i
read
everyth
i
could
i
creat
an
extrem
detail
timelin
of
the
ship
s
few
day
and
a
veri
detail
timelin
of
the
last
night
of
it
life
he
said
43
and
i
work
within
that
to
write
the
script
and
i
got
some
histor
expert
to
analyz
what
i
d
written
and
comment
on
it
and
i
adjust
it
43
he
paid
meticul
attent
to
detail
even
includ
a
scene
depict
the
californian
s
role
in
titan
s
demis
though
thi
wa
later
cut
see
below
from
the
begin
of

they
had
a
veri
clear
pictur
of
what
happen
on

that
night
i
had

becaus
i
want
it
to
be
right
especi
if
we
were
go
to
dive
to

he
said
that
set
the
bar
higher
in
a
way
–
it
elev
the
movi
in
a
sens
we
want
thi
to
be
a
definit
visual
of
thi
moment
in
histori
as
if
you
d
gone
back
in
a
time
machin
and
shot
it
43
cameron
felt
the
titan
sink
wa
like
a
great
novel
that
realli
happen
but
that
the
event
had
becom
a
