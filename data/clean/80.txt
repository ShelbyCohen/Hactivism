debunk
the

about

how
parker
demonstr
that

choic
not

becaus
of
it
for
parker
the

are
misguid
at
best
the

manifest
itself
in

that
extend

so
you

and
someon
say
someth
ignor
and
while
you
know
that
they
re
in
the
wrong
and
that
you
could
total
engag
them
and
win
if
you
were
a
bit
more
prepar
your
word
escap
you
to
make
sure
that
doesn
t
happen
we
ve
compil
a
seri
of
handi
refer
guid
with
the
most
common
argument
—
and
your
counter
argument
—
for
all
of
the
hot
button
issu
of
the
day
thi
week
s
topic
how
to
argu
the
pro
choic
posit
common
argument
1
a
fetu
is
a
human
be
and
human
be
have
the
right
to
life
so
abort
is
murder
your
respons
i
m
probabl
not
go
to
convinc
you
that
a
fetu
isn
t
a
life
as
that
s
basic
the
most
intract
part
of
thi
whole
debat
so
i
ll
be
brief
a
fetu
can
t
surviv
on
it
own
it
is
fulli
depend
on
it
mother
s
bodi
unlik
born
human
be
even
if
a
fetu
wa
aliv
the
right
to
life
doesn
t
impli
a
right
to
use
somebodi
els
s
bodi
peopl
have
the
right
to
refus
to
donat
their
organ
for
exampl
even
if
do
so
would
save
somebodi
els
s
life
the
right
to
life
also
doesn
t
impli
a
right
to
live
by
threaten
somebodi
els
s
life
bear
children
is
alway
a
threat
the
life
of
the
mother
see
below
a
right
to
life
is
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
right
to
not
have
somebodi
els
s
will
impos
upon
your
bodi
do
women
not
have
thi
right
as
well
common
argument
2
if
a
woman
is
will
to
have
sex
she
s
knowingli
take
the
risk
of
get
pregnant
and
should
be
respons
for
her
action
your
respons
you
re
assert
that
give
birth
is
the
respons
choic
in
the
event
of
a
pregnanc
but
that
s
just
your
opinion
i
d
argu
that
if
a
mother
know
she
won
t
be
abl
to
provid
for
her
child
it
s
actual
more
respons
to
have
an
abort
and
in
do
so
prevent
a
whole
lot
of
undu
suffer
and
miseri
but
let
s
look
at
thi
argument
a
bit
further
if
you
think
get
an
abort
is
avoid
respons
that
impli
that
it
s
a
woman
s
respons
to
bear
a
child
if
she
choos
to
have
sex
that
sound
suspici
like
you
re
dictat
what
a
woman
s
role
and
purpos
is
and
a
lot
less
like
you
re
make
an
argument
about
the
life
of
a
child
common
repli
no
becaus
women
can
practic
safe
sex
and
avoid
get
pregnant
if
she
refus
to
use
contracept
and
get
pregnant
as
a
result
that
s
her
fault
and
her
respons
your
rebutt
not
everyon
ha
easi
access
to
contracept
nor
doe
everyon
have
a
good
enough
sex
educ
class
to
know
how
to
use
it
or
where
to
obtain
it
but
let
s
just
suppos
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
everyon
had
access
to
free
contracept
and
knew
how
to
use
it
correctli
even
then
no
contracept
is
100
percent
effect
presum
you
oppos
abort
even
in
case
where
contracept
fail
and
it
doe
sometim
fail
even
when
use
perfectli
if
that
s
true
you
re
say
that
by
mere
choos
to
have
sex
—
with
or
without
a
condom
—
a
woman
becom
respons
for
have
a
child
and
that
s
a
belief
that
ha
everyth
to
do
with
judg
a
woman
s
behavior
and
noth
to
do
with
the
valu
of
life
common
argument
3
but
i
m
okay
with
abort
in
case
of
rape
your
respons
whi
onli
in
those
case
are
the
live
of
children
who
were
conceiv
by
rape
worth
less
than
the
live
of
children
who
were
will
conceiv
if
preserv
the
life
of
the
child
take
primaci
over
the
desir
of
the
mother
—
which
is
what
you
re
say
if
you
if
you
oppos
ani
legal
abort
—
then
it
shouldn
t
matter
how
that
life
wa
conceiv

argument

if
it
