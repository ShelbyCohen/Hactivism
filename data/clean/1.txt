i
think
the
term
“
resili
”
refer
to
our
own
quailti
that
allow
us
to
adapt
and
surviv
precis
becaus
we
may
have
had
some
of
the
resourc
avail
to
us
in
childhood
ot
later
as
suggest
in
the
resili
questionnair
so
it
’
s
realli
about
semant
your
“
take
”
on
what
the
question
are
about
is
percept
–
the
questionnair
doe
probe
for
childhood
resourc
that
were
avail
to
us
but
the
term
“
resili
”
is
also
apt
as
our
own
greater
adapt
or
resili
is
the
result
of
have
had
those
resourc
at
some
point
psycholog
speak
resili
is
what
we
attain
when
we
are
at
last
abl
to
intern
extern
sourc
of
support
or
ani
“
avail

doe
the
term
“

now
make
more
sens
in
thi
light
to
you
i
includ
a
good
mani
year
of
therapi
post
childhood
in
my
own
avail
resourc
that
have
led
to
greater
resili
so
i
don
’
t
think
“
avail
resourc
”
stop
at
childhood
’
s
end
later
we
can
take
step
ourselv
that
help
us
make
use
of
resourc
for
understand
recoveri
and
surviv
i
think
peopl
should
not
think
of
their
current
condit
of
health
or
“
di

”
as
indic
by
a
test
score
and
difficult
or
abis
childhood
as
perman
but
as
a
start
place
from
which
we
can
now
make

to
obtain
resourc
that
may
have
been
lack
in
the
past
it
doe
requir
effort
to
avail
ourselv
of
resourc
and
sometim
long

effort
over

but
we
can
take
first
step
or
continu
step
everi

to
improv
our

outcom
it
realli
is
never

it

die

wouldn

they
should
be

the
fact
is
that
it
is
men
who
are
die
more

and
earlier
than
the

it
is
also
a
fact
that
men

5

shorter

hi

–
thank
for

i
am
bet
you
are
correct
that
there
are
some
reason
beyond
our
present
understand
that
play
out
in
how
we
respond
to
stress
the
work
of
shelli
taylor
on
stress
is
a
good
exampl
where
she
found
that
men
and
women
were
fundament
differ
in
their
respons
to
stress
with
the
male
more
like
to
fight
flight
and
the
femal
more
like
to
do
what
she
name
“
tend
and
befriend
”
that
is
women
move
more
toward
interact
while
men
are
more
like
to
move

i

male
male
competit
and
precari
manhood
all
of
these
play
a
role
in
men
’
s

and
i
am
guess
they
may
also
be
involv
in
how
their

manifest
in
their
bodi
the
other
piec
of
thi
is
the
likelihood
that
men
have
under
report
on
their
ace
score
due
to
the
provid

protect
role
and
precari
manhood
men
are

to

that
would

a

of

is
about

in

men
are
taught

when

that

anger

here
as

those
are
the
fact
thi
doesn

the

the

rate
of

are
one
such
area
where
a

can
lead

it

not

a

more

and

we

i
don

see

as
a

though
i
can
see
how
that
view
can
develop
when
men

are
so
underserv
as
they
are
while
the
socio

tendenc
are
to
protect
the
vulner
defin

era
of
our

histori
as
widow
women

often
exclud
men
that
doe

the
actual

of
all
group
which
are
also
often

by
a

practic
that
render
them
less

social
there
may
also
be
genet
to
consid
sinc
male
do
die
at

than
femal
from

and
onward
even
befor
cultur
condit
begin
to
set
in
not
all
ill
or
riski
behavior
is
caus
by
trauma
then
caus
for
men
’
s
greater
degre
of
ill
death
and
other
are
complex
and
not
onli
releat
to
who
suffer
more
abus
in

there
are
mani
cultur
factor
includ
those
which
social
men
as
the
“
protector
”
of
other
and
other
as
“

i
have
to
say
though
that
from
my
own
experi
abus
which
young
boy
and
men
may
suffer
can
be
particularli
brutal
and
brutal
howev
there
are
also
lifelong
form
of
damag
which
result
from
the
abus
of
children

women
who
may
have
a
lesser
abil
to
fight
back
and
who
are
similarli
expect
to
“

as
in
not

so
again
realli
i
don
’
t
see
thi
as
a
contest
over
who
suffer

whose

of

are
more
damag
we
need
to
embrac

damag
rather
than
discount
anyon
els

doe
that

i

i

m
say
that
it
is
good
to

that
it
is
possibl
to

the

intellig
over

familiar

he
would
come
and
say
sorri

about

my

my

would
be

sinc
zero

except

14
for

“

noth
but
—
like

were
enforc

to
push
us
away
from

13
i
wa
“
an

”
becaus
with
zero
parent
often
come
prematur
ego
develop
and
zero
trust
of

so
like
“
the

”
we
“
grow

and
we
grow
up
mean
our

get
hard
and

”
not
mental
health
and
14
“
life
is
what
you
make
it
”
is
often
also
produc
that
way
so
i
still
think
my
childhood
resili

is
zero
now
as

“
how

well
i

i
can

claim

“
when

that

that
although

two
reason
one
wa

is
that

with

it
would
still
be
consider
work
but
less
pain
and

in

it
anoth
great
techniqu
if
your

know

is
samyama
in
which
you
notic
the
“

go
on
in

allow
yourself
to
drop

there
is

just
pure

if

let

what

experi
child
abus
condit
our
littl
impression
mind
to
accept
stress
and
neg
as
the
norm
and
as
adult
we
automat
creat
the
situat
all
over
again
to
get
the

chemic
brain
reaction
we
have
been
taught
to
be
comfort

we
don

feel
normal
if
the
onli
attent
we
receiv
as

then
as

we
will
subconsci
creat
chaotic
situat

“

also
it

there
is

the
key
is
in
your
post
about
how
you
said
you
do

without

you

condit
yourself
to
do

with

the

is
we
do
think
first
we
just
don

it

comfort
for

out

yet
the
4
of

were
continu
left
in

she
threaten
to
kill
us
on
almost
a
daili
basi
and
told
us
such
thing
as
she
had
poison
our

but
we
didn

know
which
meal
or
which
type

wa
to
put
us
all
in

car
secur
in

then
drive
to
the
edg
of
a
local
pier
and
tell
us
that
if
she
even
heard
us
breath
…
she
would
drive
the
car
into
the
water
and
we
would
all
drown
togeth

a

here

surviv
sever
childhood
trauma
there
spring
an
ongo
sourc
of
grief
and
loss
as
other

unfold
throughout

live
the
problem
is
that
we
are
alway
tri
to
play
‘
catch
up
’
with
what
we
view
the
rest
of
societi
alreadi
somehow
know
and
we
lack
even
those
who
might
be
view
as
determin
over
achiev
and
self
driven
peopl
such
as
myself
deepli
feel
the
wound
and
the
loss
of
what
we
do
not
possess
sometim
i
feel
amaz
that
i
can
learn
ani
subject
i
put
my
mind
to
can
easili
speak
with
and
sell
to
peopl
from
the
poorest
of
circumst
to
the
wealthiest
know
that
i
can
produc
ani
materi
result
that
i
want
…
except
when
it
come
to
my
interperson
relationship
those
are
too
deep
and
too
close
for
me
to
be
realli
veri
good
at
and
are
alway
inevit
my
achil
heel
you
see
i
lack
the
abil
to
truli
connect
in
the
manner
in
which
i
desir
the
onli
peopl
i
have
ever
felt
that
connect
with
or
for
were
my
own
children
i
never
knew
how
much
love
i
wa
capabl
of
until
i
saw
each
of
their
littl
face
and
held
them
for
the
first
time
in
my
arm
it
is
those
biolog
and
incalcul
chang
that
somehow
occur
within
our
chemistri
that
rais
us
to
be
more
than
we
even
imagin
we
could
be
despit
what
happen
in
the
past
i
cannot
claim
to
know
what
will
stop
the
cycl
and
pattern
of
abus
from
gener
to
gener
though
the
question
is
one
i
ponder
frequent
in
my
younger
day
i
had
thought
i
would
be
the
one
in
my
famili
to
break
thi
gener
curs
of
sort
but
the
problem
with
come
from
such
abus
without
help
or
true
guidanc
is
that
you
are
not
even
awar
of
the
littl
thing
you
yourself
are
do
to
promot
it
ongo
pattern
that
is
whi

after

an

join
thi

as
it
is
the
first
of

that
i

across
a

by
those
who

and
want
to
be
a
part
in
identifi
the
indic
and
stop
it
through
help
and
understand
–
not
legal
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
the
will
of
ani
of
us
to
continu
thi
legaci
i
believ
it
is
the
ignor
of
where
we
came
from
that
somehow
subconsci
propel
us
along
a
similar
path
that
may
not

believ
it
is
the
lack

for

that
caus
us
to
somehow
‘
miss

how
we
are
not

compassion

though
it
may
be
outwardli
subtl
or
non

until
we
are
too

in
to
easili
get
out
without

by

in

i
did
caus

who
i

as
far
as

i
could
walk
and
talk
it
also
probabl
didn

help
that
my
dad
wa

but
the
alcohol
is
not
what
i
rememb
be
the
problem
i
rememb
my
dad
drank
and
whatnot
but
i
think
he
drank
becaus
my

is
and
wa
such
a

neg
my

but
he
ha
hi

i

cuz
he
is
such
a
happi
guy
and
fun
to
be

my

blame
him
for
her
neg
but
i
don
’
t
see
it
that
way
i
think
she
is
just
gener
a
miser
person
and
therefor
make
everyon
around
her
miser
ye
so
much
so
that
she
led
him
to
drink
i
’
m
not
blame
everyth
on
her
i
took
her
side
and
wa
mad
at
my
dad
for
the
first
18
year
of
my

until
i
realiz
thi

question
the

did
not
ask
concern
whether
or
not
one
receiv
mental
health
counsel
and
had
have
pet
i
did
receiv
counsel
but
not
until
after
my
parent
’
divorc
which
i
wa
happi
about
becaus
it
got
me
away
from
the
abus
when
i
wa
14
y
o
while
my
mother

are
dead
some
are
still
live
devout
evangel
i
knew
they
still
love

despit
their
view
on

howev
onc
they
found
out
what
my
bio
father
wa
do
to
me
they
grant
my
mother
to
divorc
him
and
get
me
away
from
him
so
on
one
level
i
had
a
lot
of
love
but
not
a
lot
of
understand
until
my
mother
admit
what
wa
happen
even
then
there
wasn

t
complet
understand
becaus
i
wasn
’
t
allow
to
sent
him
to

due
to
my

which
also
anger
me

even
so
