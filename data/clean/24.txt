the
most
notabl

between

is
the
structur
tolkien

thi
wa
done
partli
to
fit
more
close
the
timelin
indic
by

one
notabl
chang
in
plot
is
that
in
the
film
théoden
is
possess
by
saruman
wherea
in
the
book
he
is
simpli
depress
and
delud
by
wormtongu
afterward
in

théoden
is
still
unsur
of
what
to
do
and
flee
to

when
he

hi
charact
is

at

end
éomer
himself
is

battl
in
the
book
on
the
way
to
helm
s
deep
the
refuge
from
edora
are
attack
by
warg
the
scene
is
possibl
inspir
by
one
in
the
book
cut
from
the
fellowship
of
the
ring
where
it
is
the
fellowship
who
battl
them
here
a
new
subplot
is
creat
where
aragorn
fall
over
a
cliff
and
is
assum
to
be
dead
jackson
ad
it
to
creat
tension
17
thi
scene
also
reson
with
a
new
subplot
regard
arwen
where
she
decid
to
leav
middl
earth
after
lose
hope
in
the
long
term
possibl
of
her
love
in
the
book
arwen
s
role
is
primarili
record
in
the
appendic
and
she
is
never
depict
as
consid
such
an
act
a
larger
chang
wa
origin

elrond
would

galadriel
and
arwen
would
accompani
an

to
fight
alongsid
aragorn
dure
shoot
the
script
chang
both
from
writer
come
up
with
better
idea
to
portray
the
romanc
between
aragorn
and
arwen
as
well
as
poor
fan
reaction
16
18
the
new
scene
of
arwen
leav
for
the
west
wa
creat
and
the
convers
scene
remain
edit
to
be
a
flashback
to
a
convers
between
them
in

on
the
even
befor
the

departur
16
a
convers
between
elrond
and

edit
to
be

one
19
nonetheless
one
major
chang
alreadi
film
remain
that
could
not
be
revers
the
elven
warrior
fight
at
helm
s
deep
although
jackson
and
boyen
found
thi
romant
and
stir

a
refer

how
in

appendic
of
the
return
of

16
anoth
chang
is
the
fact
treebeard
doe
not

thi
add
to

here
the
