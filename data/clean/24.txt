thoreau
tell

audienc
that

must
put

blame
on
those

are
not

to

there
are
thousand
who
are

see

thoreau
s

which
also
advanc
thi
argument
he
exhort
peopl
not
to
just
wait
passiv
for
an
opportun
to
vote
for
justic
becaus
vote
for
justic
is
as
ineffect
as
wish
for
justic
what
you
need
to
do
is
to
actual
be
just
thi
is
not
to
say
that
you
have
an
oblig
to
devot
your
life
to
fight
for
justic
but
you
do
have
an
oblig
not
to
commit
injustic
and
not
to
give
injustic
your
practic
support
pay
tax
is
one
way
in
which
otherwis
well
mean
peopl
collabor
in
injustic
peopl
who
proclaim
that
the
war
in
mexico
is
wrong
and
that
it
is
wrong
to
enforc
slaveri
contradict
themselv
if
they
fund
both
thing
by
pay
tax
thoreau
point
out
that
the
same
peopl
who
applaud
soldier
for
refus
to
fight
an
unjust
war
are
not
themselv
will
to
refus
to
fund
the
govern
that
start
the
war
in
a
constitut
republ
like
the
unit
state
peopl
often
think
that
the
proper
respons
to
an
unjust
law
is
to
tri
to
use
the
polit
process
to
chang
the
law
but
to
obey
and
respect
the
law
until
it
is
chang
but
if
the
law
is
itself
clearli
unjust
and
the
lawmak
process
is
not
design
to
quickli
obliter
such
unjust
law
then
thoreau
say
the
law
deserv
no
respect
and
it
should
be
broken
in
the
case
of
the
unit
state
the
constitut
itself
enshrin
the
institut
of
slaveri
and
therefor
fall
under
thi
condemn
abolitionist
in
thoreau
s
opinion
should
complet
withdraw
their
support
of
the
govern
and
stop
pay
tax
even
if
thi
mean
court
imprison
under
a
govern
which
imprison
ani
unjustli
the
true
place
for
a
just
man
is
also
a
prison
…
where
the
state
place
those
who
are
not
with
her
but
against
her
–
the
onli
hous
in
a
slave
state
in
which
a
free
man
can
abid
with
honor
…
cast
your
whole
vote
not
a
strip
of
paper
mere
but
your
whole
influenc
a
minor
is
powerless
while
it
conform
to
the
major
it
is
not
even
a
minor
then
but
it
is
irresist
when
it
clog
by
it
whole
weight
if
the
altern
is
to
keep
all
just
men
in
prison
or
give
up
war
and
slaveri
the
state
will
not
hesit
which
to
choos
if
a
thousand
men
were
not
to
pay
their
tax
bill
thi
year
that
would
not
be
a
violent
and
bloodi
measur
as
it
would
be
to
pay
them
and
enabl
the
state
to
commit
violenc
and
shed
innoc
blood
thi
is
in
fact
the
definit
of
a
peaceabl
revolut
if
ani
such
is
possibl
10
becaus
the
govern
will
retali
thoreau
say
he
prefer
live
simpli
becaus
he
therefor
ha
less
to
lose
i
can
afford
to
refus
allegi
to
massachusett
…
it
cost
me
less
in
everi
sens
to
incur
the
penalti
of
disobedi
to
the
state
than
it
would
to
obey
i
should
feel
as
if
i
were
worth
less
in
that
case
11
he
wa
briefli
imprison
for
refus
to
pay
the
poll
tax
but
even
in
jail
felt
freer
than
the
peopl
outsid
he
consid
it
an
interest
experi
and
came
out
of
it
with
a
new
perspect
on
hi
relationship
to
the
govern
and
it
citizen
he
wa
releas
the
next
day
when
someon
interf
and
paid
that
tax
12
thoreau
said
he
wa
will
to
pay
the
highway
tax
which
went
to
pay
for
someth
of
benefit
to
hi
neighbor
but
that
he
wa
oppos
to
tax
that
went
to
support
the
govern
itself
—
even
if
he
could
not
tell
if
hi
particular
contribut
would
eventu
be
spent
on
an
unjust
project
or
a
benefici
one
i
simpli
wish
to
refus
allegi
to
the
state
to
withdraw
and
stand
aloof
from
it
effectu
13
becaus
govern
is
man
made
not

or
an

thoreau
hope
that
it
maker
could
be

rather

would

i
made
my
first

with
the

fascin
by
the

of

to
cooper

no

ha
been
more

almost
all

that

now

such
wa
the
case
they
think
in
the
revolut

if

were
to
tell
me
that
thi
wa
a
bad
govern
becaus
it

certain
foreign
commod
brought

it
is
most
probabl
that

should
not

i
can

all

possibl
thi

enough
good
to

balanc
the

at

it
is
a

evil
to

when
the
