noth
if
there
is
no
struggl
there

no

those
who

are
men
who
want

they
want

they

thi
struggl
may
be
a
moral
one
or
it
may
be

what
carl

but
it
is
also
true
as
oglesbi
and
all
other

understand
that
human

are
actor
in
their

they
don

t
wait
for
the

instead
they
“

what
karl

after
a
quick
overview
of

like

–
the
cours
proce
chronolog
look
at
the
key
movement
in
each
major
period
of
the
20th
centuri
for
each
movement
we
examin
the
major
social

polit
condit
that
led
peopl
to
feel
oppress
angri
frustrat
and
or
hope
enough
to

to

i
want
student
to
consid
whi
as
frederick
dougla
understood
peopl
often
endur
a
great
deal
of
suffer

humili
befor
they
resist

rebel
do
they
think
that
their

thu
not
worth
tri
to
chang
do
they
fear
repris
for

hint
of

for

get
fire
if
they
particip

a

organ
campaign
do
they
lack
the
knowledg
to
understand
what
chang
are
possibl
or
lack
the
skill
to
identifi
and
challeng
those
who
have
power
over
them
then
someth
happen
to
alter
these
calcul
what
wa
happen
in
the
societi
that
catalyz
a

of
peopl
to

their

routin
and
particip

what

trigger
peopl
to
organ
but
find
the
will
to
organ
doesn

t
guarante
that
they
will
do
so
success
so
we
also
ask
what
sourc
of

what
strategi

do

employ
how

what
is

and
so
on
how
do
activist

balanc
the
tension
between
be
outsid

that
wa
a
question
that
martin

one
of
the
read
i
alway
incorpor

my

social

are
about
mobil
peopl
for

so
the
cours
examin
the
intern
dynam
of

to
get
at
thi
question
we
explor
the
differ
way
that
peopl
are
recruit
to

and
how
they
particip
in

everi
movement
ha
a
divis

how

thi
happen
all
success
movement
requir
organ
larg
and
small
to

so
we
look
at

the

and
the

to
explor
what
role
they
play
in

but
how
do
these
organ
emerg

sustain
themselv
to
answer
that
question
we
look
at
how
