mani
of
us
are
out
there
awaken
to
their
psychiatr

wow
my
heart
feel
so
full
right
now
so
full
i
just
got
back
from
meet
up
with
someon
i
wa
on
a
psych
ward
with
a
number
of
year
ago
it
wa
their
first
encount
with
psychiatri
by
that
time
i
wa
well
establish
in
my
mental
patient
career
we
didn
’
t
stay
in
touch
as
we
went
our
separ
way
and
they
’
d
continu
on
the
mental
patient
path
for
a
number
of
year
to
follow
…
until
they
began
to
wake
up
i
ask
them
how
it
happen
and
thi
is
what
they
said
they
didn
’
t
find
a
book
or
a
person
or
a
websit
…
they
found
someth
insid
of
themself
that
told
them
“
all
of
thi
…
these
diagnos
thi
treatment
these
drug
they
aren
’
t
your
answer
”
so
they
began
to
come
off
the
pill
and
educ
themselv
onlin
about
withdraw
which
is
how
they
found
me
i
guess
they
recogn
my
face
in
daniel
mackler
’
s
film
‘
come
off
psych
drug
’
how
cool
they
track
me
down
on
facebook
and
reach
out
to
say
hi
and
we
met
up
just
a
coupl
hour
ago
we
launch
right
into
a
most
wonder
exchang
about
the
lie
we
were
sold
by
the
so
call
“
mental
health
system
”
the
way
the
drug
shut
us
down
and
disconnect
us
from
the
veri
begin
but
we
’
d
been
so
effect
trick
into
think
it
wa
our
“
treatment
resist
mental
ill
”
that
it
never
cross
our
mind
it
might
possibl
be
the
“
treatment
”
itself
they
’
ve
been
free
from
drug
for
two
month
now
and
though
they
’
re
feel
the
intens
of
withdraw
—
as
so
mani
of
us
do
—
they
’
re
aliv
and
awak
and
fire
up
about
chang
the
world
they
vibrat
with
life
forc
it
wa
beauti
we
talk
about
the
role

us

there
’
s
someth
wrong
with
us
as
individu
and
not
the

we
live
in
and
what
amaz
me
the
most
is
that
my
friend
came
to
all
of
these
learn
in
complet

…
they
hadn

in

dream
last
night
i
sat
at
a
tabl
across
from
mani
of
the
so
call
“

profession
”
i
saw
over
my
fourteen
year
as
a
mental
patient
they
’
d
all
come
togeth
to
put
me
on
trial
for
my
freedom
—
it
wa
a
commit

and
they
were
make
the
case
that
i
need
to
be
incarcer
and
“

against
my
will
becaus
my
activ

though
i
wa
grate
to
wake
up
and
discov
thi
wa
just
a
dream
i
wa
also
immedi
full
of
sad
for
as
i
lay
there
in
my
bed
free
i
thought
about
the
countless
peopl
across
the
world
today
who
aren

who
are
sit
on
trial
for
their
freedom
and
bodili
integr
under
the
guis
of
“

”
as
i
write
these
word
and
i
thought
as
well
about
how
my
dream
is
perhap
not
that
far
from
realiti
for
mani
of
us
in
thi
fight
inde
it
is
a

act

courag
to

sit
at

as

reli
upon

what
faster
easier
or
more
reliabl
way
is
there
to
disappear
dissent
than
to
call
it
“

lock
it
away
on

ward
and
drug
it
into
silenc
tell
the
outsid
world
it
’

“

”
thi
massiv
fight
against

oppress
will
take
gener
of
struggl
and
it
complex
bring
with
it
mani
question
but
as
i
sit
here
and
reflect
on
the
mean
of
my
dream
there
’
s
one
thing
that
’
s
unquestion
to
me
no
matter
how
danger
the
road
ahead
may
be
for
us
the
solut
isn

t
to
back
away
in
fear
but
to
put
ourselv
out
there
in
ever
more
courag
way
the
solut
is
not
to
tame
our
messag
so
that
it
becom
palat
enough
for
us
to
“
sit

with
