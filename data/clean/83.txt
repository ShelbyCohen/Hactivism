at

it
becam
increasingli
clear
that
the
idea
that
the

and
benevol
wa
erron
at
key
moment
in

histori
there
had
been
consider
debat
over
how
to
structur
the

and
it
wa
never
a

conclus
that
the

should
be
turn
over
to
power
commerci

to
do
with
as
they
pleas
inde
my

found
that
there
wa

especi
in
the
progress
era
1900
–
15
and
the
1930
and

a
more
accur

to
understand
the
relationship
of

to
polit
economi
in
the

in
the

sinc
the

wa
that
becaus
the

our

the

those

some
of
the

in

is
that
by

it

there
will
