experi
he
left
harvard
dure
hi
junior
year
to
work
with
the
civil
right
movement
in

in

one
of
the
lesson
he
draw
from
hi
decad
work
in

studi
social

is
that
moral
urgenc
—
a
sens
of
injustic
or
even
anger
—
is
often
need
to
move
individu
to
act
thi
is
often
accompani
by

the
sens
of
the
plausibl

possibl
action
of
thi
kind
may
produc

thi
had
the
effect
of
turn
what
the
student
saw
as
a
moral
urgent
problem
into
a
practic
urgent
problem
for
decis
maker
to
resolv
“
how
