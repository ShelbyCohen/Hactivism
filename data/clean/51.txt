show
how

appeal
more
to

than

and
then
ask
for
‘

strategi
’
to
remedi
the
situat
thi
respons
pick
up
where
they
leav
off
as
jack
snyder
point
out
the
oppress
often
embrac
univers
caus
for
specif
and
local
reason
‘
the
christian
say
i
don

t
have

hallelujah
’
mobilis
have
often
been
slow
to
understand
thi
in
1960
regi
debray
arriv
at
the
école

to
be
initi
into

by

debray

but
wa
then
captur
in
bolivia
with
che
guevara
two
year
later
look
back
on
thi
period
what
struck
debray
abov
all
wa
marxism
’
s
lack
of
appeal
it
wa
‘
song
of
struggl
’
charismat
leadership
and
a
whole
panopli
of
revolutionari
symbol
root
in
local
histori
and
concern
that
mobilis
the
mass
human
right
by
contrast
as
sam
moyn
point
out
in
a
comment
on
ron
crow
and
golden
‘
have
not
succeed
in
offer
the
world
breviari
flag
or
anthem
’
as
a
ralli
call
they
remain
somewhat
cold
and
ether
‘
scandinavian
religion
’
as
debray
put
it
mockingli
is
it
ani
wonder
therefor
that
their
appeal
still
remain
limit
to
global
elit
wikimedia
tantal
public
domain
the
key
to
‘
new
and
better
mobilis
’
then
is
the
develop
of
univers
appeal
symbol
languag
adapt
to
local
circumst
stephen
hopgood
doubt
we
will
see
thi
ani
time
soon
in
hi
view
amnesti
intern
onc
had
mobilis
symbol
deepli
root
in
northern
european
protest
cultur
but
these
are
now
unsuit
for
a
globalis
movement
there
is
of
cours
a
‘
new
york
geneva
london
center
ideolog
’
he
call
‘
human
right
’
with
it
own
institut
and
hero
the
icc
kofi
annan
etc
but
thi
ha
no
reson
beyond
the
global
1
in
the
quest
for
better
strategi
there
are
i
think
two
conclus
one
might
draw
from
thi
one
would
be
to
embrac
the
lack
of
ani
univers
languag
and
seek
to
support
ani
group
that
appear
to
share
your
object
howev
they
describ
what
they
are
do
thi
mean
‘
go
with
the
grain
’
in
develop
parlanc
it
is
a
human
right
strategi
more
than
a
human
right
movement
the
upsid
is
that
activist
and
donor
would
be
encourag
to
enhanc
rather
than
co
opt
and
transform
alreadi
success
local
form
of
mobilis
be
they
religi
civic
or
whatev
the
downsid
which
hada
ziv
identifi
in
a
comment
on
her
own
piec
is
that
constant
vigil
would
be
requir
‘
i
must
alway
check

re
check

the

choos

’
human
loyalti
howev
inevit
form
across
polit
divid
thi
is
a
delic
busi
a
second
path
would
be
to
identifi
a
‘
thinner
’
more
global
relev
human
right
languag
mobilis
should
not
be
too
worri
if
it
take
on
differ
form
in
differ
local
context
they
should
see
it
as
simpli
a
welcom
instanc
of
what
salli
engl
merri
call
‘
vernacularis
’
thi
term
is
help
becaus
it
point
back
explicitli
to
missionari
discuss
of
similar
question
in
the
earli
twentieth
centuri
i
believ
and
not
for
religi
reason
that
these
parallel
deserv
seriou
consider
for
new
‘
ecumen
’
approach
the
main
challeng
wa
to
identifi
when
broaden
the
global

risk
advoc
non
christian
caus
how
could
they
tell
whether
it
wa
realli
christian
or
realli
human
right
that
had
vernacularis
as
snyder
point
out
the
danger
for
thi
today
are
veri
real
bolivian
polic
and
slum
dweller
claim
for
instanc
that
it
is
their
human
right
to
lynch
crimin
whilst
polic
in
delhi
appar
believ
that
tortur
crimin
protect
the
human
right
of
the
victim
these
are
tough
but
import
choic
with
upsid
and
downsid
to
each
to
avoid
them
howev
we
must
hope
that
there
realli
is
someth
perhap
hidden
for
now
but
insid
everyon
that
we
can
call
belief
in
human
right
see
keeper
of
the
flame
p

mobilis
on

view
would
