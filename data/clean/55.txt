activ
in

a
movement
for
chang
written
by
tild
holm
it
ha
been
a
coupl
of
week
sinc
i
got
back
home
from
an
intens
week
in
indonesia
with
our
project
let
’
s
talk
equal
my
project
partner
anna
and
i
visit
sever
organ
and
doctor
in
the
suburb
of
jakarta
and
bali
the
object
of
the
trip
wa
to
gather
footag
for
our
documentari
on
matern
health
in
sweden
and
indonesia
i
wa
complet
blown
away
by
the
posit
energi
present
in
everi
offic
i
visit
despit
face
a
lot
of
resist
peopl
were
determin
and
confid
that
it
wa
worth
all
the
work
have
tri
to
understand
the
slow
and
difficult
process
for
chang
in
indonesia
i
will
tri
to
share
some
of
my
observ
here
befor
the
launch
of
our
documentari
later
thi
spring
have
grown
up
in
sweden
i
wa
rais
under
the
impress
that
certain
privileg
were
certainti
like
legal
abort
low
matern
mortal
rate
free
contracept
paid
patern
leav
the
right
to
love
regardless
of
gender
in
indonesia
none
of
these
“
certainti
”
exist
in
fact
abort
is
illeg
as
is
homosexu
parent
leav
is
exclus
for
mother
and
limit
to
3
month
onli
not
everyon
have
access
to
contracept
the
lifetim
risk
of
matern
death
is
1
in
210
also
child
marriag
is
still
legal
the
legal
age
of
marriag
for
girl
is
16
but
18
for
boy
to
me
these
fact
seem
surreal
how
can
it
be
legal
for
a
man
to
marri
a
child
but
not
anoth
man
on
a
happier
note
there
are
plenti
of
organ
work
to
chang
these
fact
and
we
had
the
privileg
of
visit
some
of
them
one
wa
the
white
ribbon
allianc
or
aliansi
pita

indonesia
who
welcom
us
to
busi
jakarta
their
mission
is
to
improv
the
situat
for
mother
and
famili
all
over
the
countri
by
work
and
educ
commun
in
what
they
call
“
alert
villag
”
one
of
these
villag
is
call
mekarsari
mekarsari
is
a
dens
popul
and
poor
villag
a
coupl
of
hour
outsid
of
jakarta
the

the
mayor
is
a
woman
which
i
wa
told

a
rariti
although
she
did
not

offic
and
the
demograph
of
the
citi
one
of
the
main
program
for

it
amus
that

peopl
in
such
a
big
countri
–
a
number
equival
