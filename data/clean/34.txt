132
the
reason
that
thi
transport
of
wast
from
northern
countri
to
the
southern
countri
take
place
is
becaus
it
is
cheaper
to
transport

dump
it
there
than
to
pay
to

not

the

that

the

132
the
reason
that
thi
transport
of
wast
from
northern
countri
to
the
southern
countri
take
place
is
becaus
it
is
cheaper
to
transport
wast
to
anoth
countri
and
dump
it
there
than
to
pay
to

the

do
not

the
countri
that

then
a

some
