the

132
the
reason
that
thi
transport
of
wast
from
northern
countri
to
the
southern
countri
take
place
is
becaus
it
is
cheaper
to
transport
wast
to
anoth
countri
and
dump
it
there
than
to
pay
to
dump
the

the

do
not

the
countri
that

often
the

had

that
they
did
not
have
room

decid
to
put
the
ash
into
the

of
a
privat

and
call
for

the

the
fight
over

132
the
reason
that
thi
transport
of
wast
from
northern
countri
to
the
southern
countri
take
place
is
becaus
it
is
cheaper
to
transport
wast
to
anoth
countri
and
dump
it
there
than
to
pay
to
dump
the
wast
in
the
produc
countri
becaus
the
third

countri
do
not
have
the
same
strict
industri
regul
as
the
more
develop

the
countri
that
the

taken
to

usual
impoverish

the
reason
that
thi
transport
of

is
becaus
it
is
cheaper
to

dump
it
there
than
to
pay
to
