the

is
a

argument

must

the
argument
say
that
if

then
you
are
besmirch
the

of
those
who

were

for

for

the

argument
is
a
standard
one
that
will
alway

employ
the
real
question
to
ask
is
doe
the
ad
backlash
outweigh
the
gain
achiev
through

the
answer
here
is
not
clear

paraphras
from

extrem

is
a

agenc
that
otherwis
are
abl
to
resist
legitim
pressur
from

abid
organ
and
broaden
the
spectrum
of

so
that
lobbi
by
mainstream
group
is
not
consid
extremist
dg
my
doctrin
is
thi
that
if
we
see
cruelti
or

that
we
have
the
power
to
stop

we
make

if

those
