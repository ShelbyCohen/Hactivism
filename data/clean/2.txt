anim
did

and
therefor
did

thi
argument
is

the

it

way
thi
also
make
it
difficult

argu
as
some

anim
don

anim
anoth
reason
for
think
that

that
even
the
most
enthusiast
support
of
anim
right
onli
argu
that
anim
have
right
against
human
be
not
against
other
anim
for
exampl
as
mari
warnock
put
it
may
they
anim
be
hunt
to
thi
the
answer
is
no
not
by
human
but
presum
their
right
are
not
infring
if
they
are
hunt
by
anim
other
than
human
be
and
here
the
real
difficulti
start
if
all
anim
had
a
right
to
freedom
to
live
their
live
without
molest
then
someon
would
have
to
protect
them
from

thi
is
absurd
m
warnock
an

s
guid
to
ethic
1998
whi
thi
might
be
relev
to
the
question
of
whether
anim
should
have
right
becom
clearer
if
you
rephras
it
in
term
of
duti
or
oblig
instead
of
right
and
ask
whi
should
human
be
have
oblig
toward
anim
if
anim
don

have
oblig
to
other
anim
or
to
human
be
top
moral
commun
thi
argument
state
that
anim
are
not
member

the
moral
commun
a
moral
commun
is
a
group
of
be
who
live
in
relationship
with
each
other
and
use
and
understand
moral
concept
and
rule
the
member
of
thi
commun
can
respect
each
other
as
moral
person
the
member
of
thi
commun
respect
each
other
s
autonomi
human
be
do
display
these
characterist
and
are
therefor
member
of
the
moral
commun
anim
do
not
display
these
characterist
and
are
therefor
not
member
of
the
moral
commun
most
peopl
would
agre
with
thi
after
all
we
don
t
regard
a
dog
as
have
done
someth
moral
wrong
when
it
bite
someon
if
the
dog
is
put
to
death
becaus
of
the
bite
that
is
to
protect
peopl
not
to
punish
the
dog
onli
member
of
a

can
have

anim
don
t
have
right
member
of
the
moral
commun
are
more
valuabl
than
be
that
are
not

of
the

it
is

the

with

in

abov
that
it

it

thi
if

thi

it

our

becaus
they

to

to
