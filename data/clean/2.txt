in

a
prima

latin
for
on
the
face
of
it
or
at

glanc
right
is
one
that
appear
to
be
applic
at

glanc
but
upon
closer
examin
may
be
outweigh
by

leav
open
the
question
of
whether
it
is
applic
and
overrid
in

particular
situat
124
the
idea
that
nonhuman
anim
are
worthi
of
prima
faci
right
is
to
say
that
in
a
sens
anim
do
have
right
howev
these
right
can
be
overridden
by

hi
view
argu
if
a
nonhuman
anim
were
to
kill
a
human
be
in
the
u
s
it
would
have
broken
the
law
of
the
land
and
would
probabl
get
rougher
sanction
than
if
it
were
a
human
my
point
is
that
like
law
govern
all
who
interact
within
a
societi
right
are
to
be
appli
to
all
be
who
interact
within
that
societi
thi
is
not
to
say
these
right
endow
by
human
are
equival
to
those
held
by
nonhuman
anim
but
rather
that
if
human
possess
right
then
so
must
all
those
who
interact
with
human
125
in
