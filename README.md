# Hactivism
Super cool project for Recommender Systems course at Ithaca College. We will use a WebCrawler that we wrote and a list of general movement topics as search queries to generate results for each event. This system will allow a user to select one (or several) movements that they care about; we will then use the top results from the event they selected to find out what other movement topics might be relevant and interesting to that user.
